\section{Inertia and Force}\index{inertia}\index{force} 

In simple terms, Dynamics is here understood as the descriptive study of the causes of motion. In the very first chapter of his \emph{Principia}, Newton inadvertently presents, in the third definition, the point of departure of Dynamics: the concept of inertia. Obscurely defined as an ``inherent force'' of matter, he states that this ``force'' is \emph{``the power of resisting by which every body, so far as it is able, perseveres in its state either of resting or of moving uniformly straight forward.\footnote{\aut{Newton}\cite{newton_1999_1}, p.50.}''} By this inherent resistance feature of matter or inertia in every body, which is modeled as a point\footnote{Also called a particle mass.}, devoid of volume, Newton meant resistance to a change of its velocity in time, that is, resistance to acceleration. Therefore, the Newtonian concept of inertia makes the old Aristotelian idea of \emph{``a thing will either be at rest or must be moved \emph{ad infinitum}, unless something more powerful gets in its way\footnote{\aut{Aristotle}\cite{aristotle_1984_1}, p.366.}''} one of its corollaries: if a body is subjected to a condition where its inertia does not manifest itself, then the body will perform a non-accelerated motion, that is, it will be either at rest or move uniformly straight forward. One of the measures of the inertia of a body is a scalar called \textsb{mass}\index{mass}, or inertial mass: the greater or lesser this scalar, the greater or lesser the inertia. For the case of bodies with volume, which is our concern here, we impose that every body must have an overall regularly distributed mass, which is also deformation independent, that is, the mass calculated on any arbitrary shape is always the mass of the body\footnote{In motions where a portion of the mass of a body is burned in order to propel another portion, the above restriction is still valid because any shape of this body as a whole must include not only the propelled portion of its mass, but also that which is burned.}. This last condition, valid only in the context of Newtonian Mechanics, is a manifestation of the \textsb{Principle of Mass Conservation}\index{mass!principle of conservation of}, which states that when there are no mass exchanges with the surroundings of a certain physical system, the total mass of this system remains constant in time.

Following the first definition of the \emph{Principia}, ``quantity of matter'', Newton presented a measure called ``quantity of motion'', which is one of the many concepts he borrowed from Galileo. Dealing with the impact of solid volumeless bodies, a subject of great interest in his time, Galileo wrote in the sixth day of \emph{Dialogs Concerning Two New Sciences} the following reasoning exposed by the character Salviati\footnote{See section \ref{sec:leoGal} for details.}: \emph{``It is evident that the property of force in the mover and of resistance [inertia] in the moved is not single and simple, but is compounded from two actions, by which their energy must be measured. One of these is the weight \emph{[mass]}, of the mover as well as of the resistent; the other is the speed \emph{[velocity]} with which the one must move and the other be moved... if with a lesser weight we wish to raise a greater, it will be necessary to arrange the machine in such a way that the smaller moving weight goes in the same time through a greater space \emph{[distance]} than does the other weight; that is to say, the former is moved more swiftly than the latter... Let us say in general, then, that the momentum of the less heavy body balances the momentum of the more heavy when the speed of the lesser has the same ratio to the speed of the greater as the heaviness of the greater has to that of the lesser...\footnote{\aut{Galileo}\cite{galileo_1989_1}, pp.289-290.}}'' In modern terms, Newton's ``quantity of motion'' or Galileo's \textsb{momentum}\index{momentum}, is defined to be a vector multiple of the velocity vector by inertial mass, that is, momentum is mass multiplied by velocity. Therefore, if a body is subjected to a condition where its inertia does manifest itself, the momentum of this body will change in time. Since inertial mass is constant in time, a change in momentum results a vector multiple of the acceleration vector by inertial mass, usually called \textsb{impulse}\index{impulse}. The notorious Newton's Second Law, as it is currently stated, specifies that impulse is the bodily manifestation which corresponds to the action of an external physical entity called force. In other words, whenever a force is applied to a body, this body will gain impulse. Now, the question is: what is force?  



In practical terms, force is defined to be a vector identical to the impulse vector.
