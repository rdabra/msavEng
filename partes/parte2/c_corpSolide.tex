Geometers who have researched the equations of equilibrium or motion of plates or of elastic or non-elastic surfaces have distinguished two types of forces produced, some by expansion or contraction, others by the flexion of these same surfaces. Moreover, they generally assumed, in their calculations, that the forces of the first type, called tensions, remain perpendicular to the lines against which they are exerted. It seemed to me that these two types of forces could be reduced by a single one, which must constantly be called tension or pressure, acting on each element of a section chosen at will, not only in a flexible surface, but also in an elastic or non-elastic solid, and which is of the same nature as the hydrostatic pressure exerted by a fluid at rest against the exterior surface of a body. However, the new pressure does not always remain perpendicular to the faces which are subjected to it, nor the same in all directions at a given point. In developing this idea, I came to recognize that the pressure or tension exerted against any plane at a given point of a solid body is very easily deduced, both in magnitude and in direction, from the pressures or tensions exerted against three rectangular planes defined through this same point. This proposition, which I have already addressed in the January 1823 edition of the \emph{Bulletin Des Sciences de La Soci\'et\'e Philomatique de Paris}, can be established using the following considerations.

If in an elastic or non-elastic solid body, a small element of volume defined by any faces is made rigid and invariable, this small element will experience on its different faces and at each point of each of them a certain pressure or tension. This pressure or tension will be similar to the pressure that a fluid exerts against an element of the surface of a solid body, with the only difference that the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest, against the surface of a solid body, is directed perpendicular to this surface from outside to inside, and independent at each point of the inclination of the surface with respect to the coordinate planes, while the pressure or tension exerted at a given point of a solid body, through which a very small surface element passes can be directed perpendicular or obliquely to this surface, sometimes from outside to inside, if there is contraction, sometimes from inside to outside, if there is expansion, and may depend on the inclination of the surface in relation to the planes in question. That being said, let $\upsilon$ be the volume of a portion of the body that has become rigid, $s$, $s'$, $s''$, ... the areas of the plane or curved surfaces which cover the volume $\upsilon$; $x$, $y$, $z$ the rectangular coordinates of a point taken at random in the surface $s$; $p$ the pressure or tension exerted at this point against the surface; $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ the angles that the perpendicular to the surface forms with the semi-axes of the positive coordinates; finally $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$ the angles formed with the same semi-axes by the direction of the force $p$. If we project onto the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes the various pressures or tensions to which the surface will be subjected, the sums of their algebraic projections on these three axes will be represented by the integrals\footnote{All the subsequent terms $\sec\gamma\, dydx$ correct the term  $\cos\gamma\, dydx$ of the original text. (TN)}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:forcas}
   \begin{dcases}
     \textstyle\iint   p\cos\lambda\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p\cos\mu\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p\cos\nu\sec\gamma\, dydx,
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
while the sums of the algebraic projections of their linear moments will be respectively
 \begin{equation}
   \begin{dcases}
     \textstyle\iint   p(y\cos\nu-z\cos\mu)\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p(z\cos\lambda-x\cos\nu)\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p(x\cos\mu-y\cos\lambda)\sec\gamma\, dydx,
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
if we take the origin of the coordinates as the center of moments, or, if we transport it to a point with coordinates $x_0$, $y_0$, $z_0$, 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:momentos}
   \begin{dcases}
     \textstyle\iint   p[(y-y_0)\cos\nu-(z-z_0)\cos\mu]\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p[(z-z_0)\cos\lambda-(x-x_0)\cos\nu]\sec\gamma\, dydx,\\
     \textstyle\iint   p[(x-x_0)\cos\mu-(y-y_0)\cos\lambda]\sec\gamma\, dydx.
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 In all these integrals, the limits of the integrations relating to variables $x$, $y$ must be determined from the shape of the contour of the surface $s$, so that inside these limits 
\begin{equation}
\textstyle\iint\sec\gamma\, dydx = s\,.
\end{equation}

If the surface $s$ becomes plane and the volume $\upsilon$ very small, so that each of its dimensions can be considered an infinitely small quantity of the first order, then the variations that the three products
\begin{equation}
p\cos\lambda,\quad p\cos\mu,\quad p\cos\nu
\end{equation}
will experience, in the passage from one point to another in the surface $s$, will still be infinitely small of the first order; and, by neglecting the infinitely small third order values in the integrals \eqref{eq:forcas}, we will reduce these integrals to the quantities
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ps}
ps\cos\lambda,\quad ps\cos\mu,\quad ps\cos\nu\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, if we make the center of moments coincide with a point in volume $\upsilon$, the integrals \eqref{eq:momentos} will be infinitely small quantities of the third order, and it will suffice to neglect, in these integrals, the infinitely small term of the fourth order, so that they are reduced to products
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:ps2}
   \begin{dcases}
        ps[(\eta-y_0)\cos\nu-(\zeta-z_0)\cos\mu],\\
       ps[(\zeta-z_0)\cos\lambda-(\xi-x_0)\cos\nu],\\
        ps[(\xi-x_0)\cos\mu-(\eta-y_0)\cos\lambda],
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 $\xi$, $\eta$, $\zeta$ designating the fractions
 \begin{equation}
 \dfrac{\textstyle\iint x\sec\gamma\, dydx}{s},\quad  \dfrac{\textstyle\iint y\sec\gamma\, dydx}{s},\quad  \dfrac{\textstyle\iint z\sec\gamma\, dydx}{s},
 \end{equation}
that is, the coordinates of the center of gravity of the surface $s$.

Now, let $m$ be the infinitely small mass related to the volume $\upsilon$. Moreover, let us consider that the letter $\varphi$ represents the accelerating force applied to this mass, if the solid body is in equilibrium, and, on the contrary case, the excess of the accelerating force applied on it which would be able to produce the observed motion of mass $m$. Finally, let us call X, Y, Z the algebraic projections of the force $\varphi$, and $\xi_0$, $\eta_0$, $\zeta_0$ the coordinates of the center of gravity of the mass $m$. If we suppose that the accelerating force $\varphi$ remains the same in magnitude and direction in all points of the mass $m$, there must be equilibrium between the driving force $m\varphi$ applied at the point $(\xi_0,\eta_0,\zeta_0)$ and the forces to which the pressures or tensions exerted on the surfaces $s$, $s'$, ... are reduced. So the sums of the algebraic projections of all these forces and their linear moments on the axes $x$, $y$, $z$ will have to be reduced to zero. So, if we want to place one or more accents after the letters $p$, $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$, $\xi$, $\eta$, $\zeta$, present in expressions \eqref{eq:ps} and \eqref{eq:ps2}, to indicate the new values that these expressions take when one passes from the surface $s$ to the surface $s'$, or $s''$, or $s''',$ ... one will find, neglecting, in the sums of the projected forces, the infinitely small of the third order, and in the sums of the projected linear moments, the infinitely small of the fourth order,
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:forcas}
   \begin{dcases}
        ps\cos\lambda+p's'\cos\lambda'+\cdots+m\text{X}=0,\\
       ps\cos\mu+p's'\cos\mu'+\cdots+m\text{Y}=0,\\
        ps\cos\nu+p's'\cos\nu'+\cdots+m\text{Z}=0;
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:momentos}
   \begin{dcases}
   \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\eta-y_0)\cos\nu-(\zeta-z_0)\cos\mu&]+p's'[(\eta'-y_0)\cos\nu'-(\zeta'-z_0)\cos\mu']+\\
        &+\cdots+m[(\eta_0-y_0)\text{Z}-(\zeta_0-z_0)\text{Y}]=0,
   \end{aligned}\\
         \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\zeta-z_0)\cos\lambda-(\xi-x_0)\cos\nu&]+p's'[(\zeta'-z_0)\cos\lambda'-(\xi'-x_0)\cos\nu']+\\
        &+\cdots+m[(\zeta_0-z_0)\text{X}-(\xi_0-x_0)\text{Z}]=0
   \end{aligned}\\
         \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\xi-x_0)\cos\mu-(\eta-y_0)\cos\lambda&]+p's'[(\xi'-x_0)\cos\mu'-(\eta'-y_0)\cos\lambda']+\\
        &+\cdots+m[(\xi_0-x_0)\text{Y}-(\eta_0-y_0)\text{X}]=0.
   \end{aligned}
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
Now, the mass $m$ being itself infinitely small of the third order, the terms which contain it will be of the third order in the formulas \eqref{eq:forcas}, of the fourth order in the formulas \eqref{eq:momentos}. We can therefore neglect these terms, and replace the formulas in question by the following
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forcas2}
   \begin{dcases}
        ps\cos\lambda+p's'\cos\lambda'+p''s''\cos\lambda''+p'''s'''\cos\lambda'''+\cdots=0,\\
       ps\cos\mu+p's'\cos\mu'+p''s''\cos\mu''+p'''s'''\cos\mu'''+\cdots=0,\\
        ps\cos\nu+p's'\cos\nu'+p''s''\cos\nu''+p'''s'''\cos\nu'''+\cdots=0;
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:momentos2}
   \begin{dcases}
   \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\eta-y_0)\cos\nu-(\zeta-z_0)\cos\mu]+p's'[(\eta'-y_0)\cos\nu'-&(\zeta'-z_0)\cos\mu']+\\
        &+\cdots=0,
   \end{aligned}\\
         \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\zeta-z_0)\cos\lambda-(\xi-x_0)\cos\nu]+p's'[(\zeta'-z_0)\cos\lambda'-&(\xi'-x_0)\cos\nu']+\\
        &+\cdots=0
   \end{aligned}\\
         \begin{aligned}
        ps[(\xi-x_0)\cos\mu-(\eta-y_0)\cos\lambda]+p's'[(\xi'-x_0)\cos\mu'-&(\eta'-y_0)\cos\lambda']+\\
        &+\cdots=0.
   \end{aligned}
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}

 If we wanted to take into account the variations that the accelerating force $\varphi$ and its projections X, Y, Z can experience, when we go from one point to another in the mass $m$, we would have to replace, in equations \eqref{eq:forcas} and \eqref{eq:momentos}, the six quantities
\begin{align*}
m\text{X},\quad m&\text{Y},\quad m\text{Z};\\[5pt]
m[(\eta_0-y_0)\text{Z}&-(\zeta_0-z_0)\text{Y}],\\
m[(\zeta_0-z_0)\text{X}&-(\xi_0-x_0)\text{Z}],\\
m[(\xi_0-x_0)\text{Y}&-(\eta_0-y_0)\text{X}]
\end{align*}
by six integrals of the form
\begin{align*}
\textstyle\iiint \rho \text{X}\,dzdydx,\quad \textstyle\iiint \rho &\text{Y}\,dzdydx,\quad \textstyle\iiint \rho \text{Z}\,dzdydx;\\[5pt]
\textstyle\iiint\rho[(y-y_0)&\text{Z}-(z-z_0)\text{Y}]\,dzdydx,\\
\textstyle\iiint\rho[(z-z_0)&\text{X}-(x-x_0)\text{Z}]\,dzdydx,\\
\textstyle\iiint\rho[(x-x_0)&\text{Y}-(y-y_0)\text{X}]\,dzdydx;
\end{align*}
$\rho$ denoting the density of the solid body at the point $(x, y, z)$, and the limits of the integrations being relative to the limits of the volume $\upsilon$. But, since the first three integrals would be infinitely small of the third order, and the last three infinitely small of the fourth order, we would still find ourselves brought back to formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2} and \eqref{eq:momentos2}. It remains to show how, with the help of these formulas, one can discover the relations that exist between the pressures or tensions exerted in a given point of a solid body against various planes carried out successively by the same point.

Let us first consider that the volume $\upsilon$ takes the form of a right prism, the two bases of which are represented by $s$ and by $s'$. We will have $s'=s$; and if, the dimensions of each base being considered as infinitely small of the first order, the height of the prism becomes an infinitely small quantity of an order greater than the first, then, neglecting, in formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2}, the infinitely small order greater than the second, we will find
\begin{equation*}
(p\cos\lambda+p'\cos\lambda')s=0, \quad(p\cos\mu+p'\cos\mu')s=0,\quad(p\cos\nu+p'\cos\nu')s=0,
\end{equation*}
or equally,
\begin{equation*}
p'\cos\lambda'=-p\cos\lambda, \quad p'\cos\mu'=-p\cos\mu,\quad p'\cos\nu'=-p\cos\nu,
\end{equation*}
and we conclude that
\begin{align*}
p&=p',\\
\cos\lambda'=-\cos\lambda,\quad \cos\mu'&=-\cos\mu,\quad \cos\nu'=-\cos\nu.
\end{align*}
These last equations, which take place only in the case where the height of the prism vanishes, comprise a theorem easy to predict, the statement of which is the following:
\begin{thm}
The pressures or tensions, at a given point of a solid body, exerted against the two faces of any plane whatsoever through this point, are equal and directly opposite forces.
\end{thm} 

Now, let 
\begin{equation}
p',\quad p'',\quad p'''
\end{equation}
be the pressures or tensions exerted at the point $(x,y,z)$ and on the side of the positive coordinates against three planes through this point parallel to the coordinate planes of $y$, $z$, of $z$, $x$ and of $x$, $y$. Moreover, $\lambda'$, $\mu'$, $\nu'$; $\lambda''$, $\mu''$, $\nu''$; $\lambda'''$, $\mu'''$, $\nu'''$ are the angles formed by the directions
of the forces $p', p'',p'''$ with the semi-axes of the positive coordinates. Finally, let us consider that the volume $\upsilon$, taking the form of a rectangular parallelepiped, is enclosed between the three points led by the point $(x, y, z)$, and three parallel planes led by a very close point $(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y, z+\Delta z)$. The pressures or tensions, supported by the faces of the parallelepiped which will end at this last point, will be approximately
\begin{equation}
p'\Delta y\Delta z,\quad p''\Delta z\Delta x,\quad p''''\Delta x\Delta y,
\end{equation}
while their algebraic projections on the axes $(x,y,z)$ will clearly reduce to the quantities
\begin{equation}
   \begin{dcases}
       p's'\cos\lambda'\Delta y\Delta z,\quad p''s''\cos\lambda''\Delta z\Delta x,\quad p'''s'''\cos\lambda'''\Delta x\Delta y,\\
       p's'\cos\mu'\Delta y\Delta z,\quad p''s''\cos\mu''\Delta z\Delta x,\quad p'''s'''\cos\mu'''\Delta x\Delta y,\\
       p's'\cos\nu'\Delta y\Delta z,\quad p''s''\cos\nu''\Delta z\Delta x,\quad p'''s'''\cos\nu'''\Delta x\Delta y.
   \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
Concerning the pressures or tensions supported by the faces which end at the point $(x, y, z)$, they will be, by virtue of Theorem I, respectively equal, but directly opposite, to those which act on the parallel faces reaching the point $(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y, z+\Delta z)$. So the algebraic projections of these new tensions will be numerically equal to the algebraic projections of the other three, but affected by opposite signs, so that each of the formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2} will become an identity. Let us add that the centers of gravity of the six faces of the parallelepiped will merge with their geometric centers, and will be located on three lines carried out parallel to the axes $(x, y, z)$ through the center of the parallelepiped, that is to say, through the point which has for coordinates
\begin{equation*}
x+\dfrac{1}{2} \Delta x,\quad y+\dfrac{1}{2} \Delta y,\quad z+\dfrac{1}{2} \Delta z.
\end{equation*}
That said, it is clear that, if we take this last point as the center of the moments, the first of the formulas \eqref{eq:momentos2} will give
\begin{align*}
p''\cos\nu''\Delta z\Delta x\dfrac{\Delta y}{2}- p'''\cos\mu'''\Delta x\Delta y&\dfrac{\Delta z}{2}-(-p''\cos\nu'')\Delta z\Delta x\dfrac{\Delta y}{2}+\\
&+(-p'''\cos\mu''')\Delta x\Delta y\dfrac{\Delta z}{2}=0
\end{align*}
and consequently 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:momentos3}
   \begin{dcases}
   p''\cos\nu'' = p'''\cos\mu'''.\\
\text{Similarly, one will find that}\\
p'''\cos\lambda''' = p'\cos\nu',\\
p'\cos\mu'=p''\cos\lambda''.
    \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
Since the axes $x$, $y$, $z$ are entirely arbitrary, the equations \eqref{eq:momentos3} obviously comprise the theorem we are going to state:
\begin{thm}
If through any point of a solid body we define two axes which intersect at right angles, and if we project onto one of these axes the pressure or tension supported by a plane perpendicular to the other at the point from which it acts, the projection thus obtained will not vary when these same axes are exchanged between them.
\end{thm} 

Let us now consider that the volume takes the form of a tetrahedron of which three edges coincide with three infinitely small lengths carried from the point $(x, y, z)$ on lines parallel to the coordinate axes. Consider the point $(x, y, z)$ to be the vertex of this tetrahedron; denote its base by $s$, and let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ be the angles formed, with its semi-axes of positive coordinates, by a perpendicular raised through a point of this base, but extended outside the tetrahedron. The three faces which end at the top of the tetrahedron will be measured by the numerical values of the products
\begin{equation}
s\cos\alpha,\quad s\cos\beta,\quad s\cos\gamma.
\end{equation}
Thereby, if one calls $p$ the pressure or tension supported by the base of the tetrahedron, and if one continues to attribute to the quantities $p'$, $p''$, $p'''$ the values which they received in equations \eqref{eq:momentos3}, the first of the formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2} will obviously give
\begin{equation*}
ps\cos\lambda-p'\cos\lambda's\cos\alpha-p''\cos\lambda''s\cos\beta-p'''\cos\lambda'''s\cos\gamma = 0
\end{equation*}
and consequently
\begin{equation}
   \begin{dcases}
   p\cos\lambda = p'\cos\lambda'\cos\alpha+p''\cos\lambda''\cos\beta+p'''\cos\lambda'''\cos\gamma.\\
\text{Similarly, one will find that}\\
p\cos\mu = p'\cos\mu'\cos\alpha+p''\cos\mu''\cos\beta+p'''\cos\mu'''\cos\gamma,\\
p\cos\nu = p'\cos\nu'\cos\alpha+p''\cos\nu''\cos\beta+p'''\cos\nu'''\cos\gamma.
    \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 So, in order to shorten expressions, we make
 \begin{equation}
   \begin{dcases}
   \text{A} = p'\cos\lambda',\\
   \text{B} = p''\cos\mu'',\\
   \text{C} = p'''\cos\nu''',\\
    \text{D} = p''\cos\nu''=p'''\cos\mu''',\\  
    \text{E} = p'''\cos\lambda'''=p'\cos\nu',\\ 
    \text{F} = p'\cos\mu'=p''\cos\lambda'',\\ 
    \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
 we will simply have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matriz}
   \begin{dcases}
p\cos\lambda = \text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma,\\
p\cos\mu = \text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma,\\
p\cos\nu = \text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma.
    \end{dcases}
 \end{equation}
These last equations show the relations which subsist, for the point $(x, y, z)$, between the algebraic projections
\begin{equation}\left\{
   \begin{array}{ccc}
\text{A}, & \text{F}, & \text{E};\\
\text{F}, & \text{B}, & \text{D};\\
\text{E}, & \text{D}, & \text{C}
    \end{array}\right.
 \end{equation}
 of pressures $p'$, $p''$, $p'''$ exerted at this point, on the side of the positive coordinates, against three planes parallel to the coordinate planes, and the algebraic projections
\begin{equation*}
p\cos\lambda,\quad p\cos\mu,\quad p\cos\nu
\end{equation*}
of the pressure or tension $p$ exerted at this same point against any plane perpendicular to a straight line which, extended from the side where the force $p$ occurs, forms, with the semi-axes of positive coordinates, the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$. 

From equations \eqref{eq:matriz}, it is easy to recognize that, if the volume $\upsilon$, instead of having the shape of a tetrahedron, is defined by any number of plane faces, the formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2} and \eqref{eq:momentos2} will always be verified. Indeed, these different faces being represented by $s$, $s'$, ..., let us call $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$; $\alpha'$, $\beta'$, $\gamma'$; ... the angles that straight lines perpendicular to the planes of these same faces, and extended outside the volume $\upsilon$, form with the semi-axes of positive coordinates. In order to obtain the first of formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2}, it will suffice to add the equations (1) on page 55\footnote{This reference concerns the article \textit{Sur Quelques Propri\'et\'es des Poly\`edres}, in the same volume of the current article, from which we extract the following excerpt. (TN).

\noindent\textbf{Theorem I} - \emph{The sum of the algebraic projections of the faces of any polyhedron on the coordinate planes results zero.} ...
\begin{equation*}
   \begin{dcases}
s\cos\alpha+s'\cos\alpha'+s''\cos\alpha''+\cdots = 0,\\
s\cos\beta+s'\cos\beta'+s''\cos\beta''+\cdots = 0,\\
s\cos\gamma+s'\cos\gamma'+s''\cos\gamma''+\cdots = 0.
    \end{dcases}\tag{1}
 \end{equation*}
}, after having respectively multiplied them by A, F, E, taking into account the first of formulas \eqref{eq:matriz}, as well as similar formulas. We establish, in the same way, the second and the third of the formulas \eqref{eq:forcas2}, by adding the equations (1) (p.55), after having respectively multiplied them by the coefficients F, B, D, or by the coefficients E, D, C. Finally, if we combine the formulas \eqref{eq:matriz} and others from the same type, not only with the equations (1) on page 55, but also with the equations (5) on page 56\footnote{Again referring to the same article of the previous footnote, this equation (5) can be expressed by the equality
\begin{equation}\left[
   \begin{array}{ccc}
\xi & \xi' & \cdots\\
\eta & \eta' & \cdots\\
\zeta & \zeta' & \cdots
    \end{array}\right]\left[
   \begin{array}{ccc}
s\cos\alpha & s\cos\beta  & s\cos\gamma\\
s'\cos\alpha' & s'\cos\beta' & s'\cos\gamma'\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots
    \end{array}\right]=\left[
   \begin{array}{ccc}
\upsilon & 0 & 0\\
0 & \upsilon & 0\\
0 & 0 & \upsilon
    \end{array}\right]\,,\tag{5}
 \end{equation}
according to what is developed in the article. (TN)
}, we will easily arrive at formulas \eqref{eq:momentos2}. 

One can easily deduce from formulas \eqref{eq:matriz}:  1\textsuperscript{o} the intensity of the force $p$; 2\textsuperscript{o} the angle between the direction of this force and the perpendicular to the plane against which it is exerted. Thereby, if we add these formulas, after having squared each of their members, we will find
\begin{align}\label{eq:p2}
\begin{dcases}
p^2 = &(\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma)^2+\\
&(\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma)^2+\\
&(\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma)^2.
\end{dcases}
\end{align}
Moreover, if we call $\delta$ the angle that we have just spoken, we will obviously have
\begin{equation}
\cos\delta = \cos\alpha\cos\lambda + \cos\beta\cos\mu+\cos\gamma\cos\nu,
\end{equation}
and consequently,
\begin{align}
\cos\delta = \dfrac{1}{p}(\text{A}\cos^2\alpha+\text{B}\cos^2\beta+\text{C}\cos^2\gamma+2\text{D}\cos\beta\cos\gamma &+2\text{E}\cos\gamma\cos\alpha+\\
&+2\text{F}\cos\alpha\cos\beta).\nonumber
\end{align}
Let us add that, if we replace the force $p$ by two components, one of which is included in the plane under consideration, and the other perpendicular to this plane, the second component will be represented, except for the sign, by the product
\begin{equation}\label{eq:componente}
\begin{dcases}
\begin{aligned}
p\cos\delta &= \text{A}\cos^2\alpha+\text{B}\cos^2\beta+\text{C}\cos^2\gamma+\\
&+2\text{D}\cos\beta\cos\gamma +2\text{E}\cos\gamma\cos\alpha+2\text{F}\cos\alpha\cos\beta.
\end{aligned}
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
Let us observe finally that this second component will be a tension or a pressure according to whether the formula \eqref{eq:componente} will have a positive or negative quantity in the second member.

Suppose now that from the point $(x, y, z)$ we define, on the perpendicular to the plane against which the force $p$ acts, a length $r$ whose square represents the numerical value of the ratio
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{p\cos\delta}
\end{equation}
and denote by $x + \text{x}$, $y + \text{y}$, $z + \text{z}$ the coordinates of the extremity of that same length. We'll have
\begin{align}
\dfrac{\text{x}}{\cos\alpha}=\dfrac{\text{y}}{\cos\beta}=\dfrac{\text{z}}{\cos\gamma}=&\pm\sqrt{\text{x}^2+\text{y}^2+\text{z}^2}=\pm r\,,\\
\dfrac{1}{p\cos\delta}=&\pm r^2;
\end{align}
and, therefore, formula \eqref{eq:componente} will give
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quadr}
\text{A}\text{x}^2+\text{B}\text{y}^2+\text{C}\text{z}^2+2\text{Dyz}+2\text{Ezx}+2\text{Fxy} = \pm 1\,.
\end{equation}
The variables x, y, z, included in equation \eqref{eq:quadr}, are the coordinates of the end of the length $r$, computed from the point $(x, y, z)$ on three rectangular axes; and this equation itself defines a quadratic surface whose center is the point $(x, y, z)$. When the polynomial
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ellip}
\begin{dcases}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}\cos^2\alpha &+\text{B}\cos^2\beta+\text{C}\cos^2\gamma+\\
&+2\text{D}\cos\beta\cos\gamma +2\text{E}\cos\gamma\cos\alpha+2\text{F}\cos\alpha\cos\beta.
\end{aligned}
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
preserves the same sign, for whatever values assigned to the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, then equation \eqref{eq:componente}, reduced to one of the following
\begin{align}
\text{A}\text{x}^2+\text{B}\text{y}^2+\text{C}\text{z}^2+2\text{Dyz}+2\text{Ezx}+2\text{Fxy} =& 1\,,\label{eq:ellip1}\\
\text{A}\text{x}^2+\text{B}\text{y}^2+\text{C}\text{z}^2+2\text{Dyz}+2\text{Ezx}+2\text{Fxy} =& -1\,,\label{eq:ellip2}
\end{align}
represents an ellipsoid. But, if the polynomial \eqref{eq:ellip} changes in sign while the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ vary, the ellipsoid in question will give way to the system of two hyperboloids, one of which will be represented by the equation \eqref{eq:ellip1}, the other by equation \eqref{eq:ellip2}; and these two hyperboloids, one of which will have a single sheet, the other two distinct sheets, will be conjugated\footnote{Regarding the properties of conjugated hyperboloids, see \emph{Le\c{c}ons sur les applications du Calcul infinit\'esimal \`a la G\'eom\'etrie}, p. 275, (\emph{OEuvres de Cauchy}, S. II, T.V)} between them, so that they will have the same center with the same axes, and will be touched in the infinite by the same conical surface of the second degree. Let us add that, in the first case, the force
\begin{equation}
 \pm p\cos\delta = \dfrac{1}{r^2}
 \end{equation}
 will always be a tension, if the polynomial \eqref{eq:ellip} is positive, a pressure if it is negative. In the second case, on the contrary, the force in question will be sometimes a pressure, sometimes a tension, according to whether the end of the vector ray $r$ is located on the surface of one or the other hyperboloid; and the same force will vanish whenever this vector ray is directed along a generatrix of the above mentioned conical surface.

It can be easily demonstrated that the normal, defined at the end of the radius vector $r$ on the surface \eqref{eq:ellip1} or \eqref{eq:ellip2}, forms, with the semi-axes of positive coordinates, angles whose cosines are proportional to the three polynomials
\begin{align*}
&\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma\,,\\
&\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma\,,\\ 
&\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma\,.
\end{align*}
So this normal will be directed along the same line as the radius vector if we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:princ}
\begin{dcases}
\begin{aligned}
&\dfrac{\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma}{\cos\alpha}\\
=&\dfrac{\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma}{\cos\beta}\\
=&\dfrac{\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma}{\cos\gamma}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
Formula \eqref{eq:princ} is verified, in fact, when the radius vector coincides with one of the axes of the surface \eqref{eq:ellip1} or \eqref{eq:ellip2}. So also we write equations \eqref{eq:matriz}, combined with formula \eqref{eq:princ}, as
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\cos\lambda}{\cos\alpha}=\dfrac{\cos\mu}{\cos\beta}=\dfrac{\cos\nu}{\cos\gamma}=\pm\dfrac{\sqrt{\cos^2\lambda+\cos^2\mu+\cos^2\nu}}{\sqrt{\cos^2\alpha+\cos^2\beta+\cos^2\gamma}}=\pm 1\,,
\end{equation}
and it follows that the force $p$ is itself directed along the radius vector $r$, or along its extension. Consequently, to the three axes of the surface \eqref{eq:ellip1} or \eqref{eq:ellip2} correspond three pressures or tensions, each of which is perpendicular to the plane against which it is exerted. We will call them \emph{principal pressures} or \emph{tensions}. It is then easy to ensure that one finds among them the \emph{maximum} pressure or tension and the \emph{minimum} pressure or tension; because, if we equal to zero the value of $p$ taken from formula \eqref{eq:p2}, and if we consider the equation
\begin{equation}
\cos^2\alpha+\cos^2\beta+\cos^2\gamma = 1\,,
\end{equation}
from which one of the three variables $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ becomes a function of the two others considered as independent, we will immediately be brought back to formula \eqref{eq:princ}.

If, starting from the point $(x, y, z)$, we had, on the perpendicular to the plane against which the force $p$ acts, a length equivalent, no longer to the square root of the ratio $\pm \frac{1}{p\cos\delta}$, but to the fraction $\frac{1}{p}$, by designating by $x + \text{x}$, $y + \text{y}$, $z+ \text{z}$ the coordinates of the end of this length, we would find
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ellip4}
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\text{x}}{\cos\alpha}=\dfrac{\text{y}}{\cos\beta}=\dfrac{\text{z}}{\cos\gamma}=&\pm\sqrt{\text{x}^2+\text{y}^2+\text{z}^2}=\pm r\,,\\
\dfrac{1}{p}=&r;
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and, consequently, the formula \eqref{eq:p2} would give
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ellip3}
(\text{Ax}+\text{Fy}+\text{Ez})^2+(\text{Fx}+\text{By}+\text{Dz})^2+(\text{Ex}+\text{Dy}+\text{Cz})^2 = 1\,.
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:ellip3} describes an ellipsoid whose axes correspond to the values of $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ determined by the formula

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{equation}
\begin{dcases}
\begin{aligned}
&\dfrac{\text{A}(\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma)+\text{F}(\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma)+\text{E}(\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma)}{\cos\alpha}\\
=&\dfrac{\text{F}(\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma)+\text{B}(\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma)+\text{D}(\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma)}{\cos\beta}\\
=&\dfrac{\text{E}(\text{A}\cos\alpha+\text{F}\cos\beta+\text{E}\cos\gamma)+\text{D}(\text{F}\cos\alpha+\text{B}\cos\beta+\text{D}\cos\gamma)+\text{C}(\text{E}\cos\alpha+\text{D}\cos\beta+\text{C}\cos\gamma)}{\cos\gamma}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
\end{scriptsize}

\noindent However, since this formula is obviously verified by the values of $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ which satisfy the formula \eqref{eq:princ}, one can affirm that the axes of the new ellipsoid are directed along the same lines of the principal pressures or tensions. We would come to the same conclusion by observing that the \emph{maximum} and \emph{minimum} values of the vector radius, that is to say the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipsoid, necessarily correspond, by virtue of equation \eqref{eq:ellip4}, the first, to the \emph{maximum} pressure or tension, the second, at \emph{minimum} pressure or tension.

By summarizing the various propositions that we have just established, we will obtain the following theorem:
\begin{thm}
If, after having made an arbitrary plane pass through a given point of a solid body, we define, from this point and on each of the half-axes perpendicular to the plane, two equivalent lengths, the first to the unit divided by the pressure or tension exerted against the plane, the second at the unit divided by the square root of this force projected on one of the semi-axes which one considers, these two lengths will be the vector rays of two ellipsoids, whose axes will be directed along the same lines.
\end{thm}
