\chapter{Tensor Algebra}


Continuing our study of Linear Algebra, whose foundations we presented in the previous chapter, let's deal now with something a bit more sophisticated, although extremely useful for describing physical phenomena concerning deformable bodies. The form and the content which we shall present about this topic differs from the usual approach available in Continuum Mechanics literature, where the concept of tensor arises suddenly, out of nowhere, and through simplistic definitions. Formally, we shall proceed the same way as we have been doing so far, in a continuous flow of successively dependent concepts, and present tensors as ordinary elements of a vector space; on the content realm, we shall not restrict ourselves to the strictly necessary, typical of pragmatic approaches, since our objective, in this and the next chapter, is to provide the reader with a generous framework of concepts related to tensors, mainly because of their mathematical beauty and also because of their wide application. 


\section{A Very Short History of Tensors}

The word ``tensor'' was used for the first time in Mathematics in 1846 by \aut{Hamilton}\cite{hamilton_1846_1} in order to designate the modulus of numbers that he called quaternions, which are a generalization of complex numbers. In 1881, \aut{Gibbs}\cite{gibbs_1881} introduced the notion of dyad as being an ``undefined product'' of two vectors, starting, in a rather obscure way, the concept that nowadays we understand as tensor product. Since the term ``tensor'' has the latin word \emph{tendere}, which means ``to stretch'', as its etymological origin, \aut{Voigt}\cite{voigt_1898_1} adopted a meaning closer to the current mechanical approach, when he used tensor to designate the combination of a vector measure, representing the forces and stretches involved, with another vector measure, normal to the surface in question.        

At the end of XIX century, after ten years conceiving his ``Absolute Differential Calculus'', the italian mathematician Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro(1853-1925) published a seminal paper entitled \emph{Méthodes de Calcul Différentiel Absolu et Leurs Applications}\footnote{See \aut{Ricci \& Levi-Civita}\cite{ricci_1900_1} and \aut{Hermann}\cite{hermann_1975}.}, together with his pupil  Tullio Levi-Civita(1873-1941), in which they established the foundations of what is known today as Tensor Analysis. In this work, a tensor or ``system'', as they called, is a measure that arises from the coefficients of polynomials like     
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^n\underbrace{{(\alpha_1)}_{i_1}\cdots{(\alpha_m)}_{i_m}}_{\mat{A}_{i_1\cdots i_m}} {(x_1)}_{i_1}\cdots {(x_m)}_{i_m}\,,
\end{equation*}
where  $n\times\cdots \times n$ ($n$ times) array $\mat{A}$ represents this measure numerically. Moreover, the values of such polynomials must be immune to changes of variables, that is,  
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^n\mat{A}_{i_1\cdots i_m} {(x_1)}_{i_1}\cdots {(x_m)}_{i_m}=
\sum_{i_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^n\mat{B}_{i_1\cdots i_m} {(y_1)}_{i_1}\cdots {(y_m)}_{i_m}\,,
\end{equation*}
where the following is valid:
\begin{equation*}
{(y_k)}_{i_k}=\sum_{j_k=1}^n\mat{C}_{i_kj_k} {(x_k)}_{j_k}\,,
\end{equation*}
from which the transformation law
\begin{equation*}
\mat{A}_{i_1\cdots i_m}=\sum_{j_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{j_m=1}^n\mat{C}_{j_1i_1}\cdots\mat{C}_{j_mi_m}\mat{B}_{j_1\cdots j_m}
\end{equation*}
can be obtained. Similarly to vector measures, a tensor must have such an abstraction level that its definition results independent of the choice of variables, that is, in expressions above, the tensor represented by $\mat{A}$ is the same tensor represented by $\mat{B}$. Thereby, in rather generic terms, a tensor was initially seen as an abstract measure that arises from the interaction of different sets of variables, arranged in an scalar-valued expression of linear character. 

Ricci's Tensor Calculus was presented by the hungarian mathematician Marcel Grossman(1878-1936) to his old school fellow Albert Einstein(1879-1955). When Einstein was developing his General Theory of Relativity, Grossman used to update him with the most recent mathematical tools available; in this case, non Euclidean geometry. During his work, Einstein noticed that there is not a preferred reference frame, inertial or not, that describes a certain physical phenomenon more adequately, that is, changes of frame do not promote qualitative modification on the description of phenomena. Since a tensor is immune to changes of variables, its use became a rather convenient mathematical tool for enabling the theory, in a concise and elegant development. About this tool and its mathematical foundations, \aut{Einstein}\cite{einstein_1915_1} wrote the following compliment: \emph{The charm of this theory will hardly scape from anyone who really understands it; it means the real triumph of the methodology of Absolute Differential Calculus, established by GAUSS, RIEMANN, CHRISTOFFEL, RICCI and LEVI-CIVITA}\footnote{Translated by me from the original \emph{Dem Zauber dieser Theorie wird sich kaum jemand entziehen können, der sie wirklich erfaßt hat; sie bedeutet einen wahren Triumph der durch GAUSS, RIEMANN, CHRISTOFFEL, RICCI und LEVI-CIVITER begründeten Methode des allgemeinen Differentialkalkuls}.}. From then on, Tensor Analysis raised to prominence: its development intensified and its application spread out to other branches of Mathematical Physics, of which Continuum Mechanics is the most relevant example.  


\section{Tensor Spaces}


Let's recall vector spaces of functions that have a tuple of vectors as argument, that is, functions whose domain is a cartesian product of many sets, each one defining a vector space. Among these function spaces, we have a particular interest in those constituted by multilinear functions, on the conditions presented in section \ref{sec:FuncLin}. In order to proceed with the theory, based on the framework already studied, we chose to adopt an approach that takes tensor spaces as vector spaces of multilinear functionals, called tensors. In more mathematical terms, given a cartesian product $U^{\times m}$ where each set $U_i$ defines a finite dimensional vector space $(U_i)_\mathcal{R}$, a function space $\evl{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}{\mathcal{R}}$, constituted by multilinear functionals, is said to be a \textsb{tensor space}\index{space!tensor} of \textsb{order}\index{order!of tensor space} $m$, whose representation is here shortened by \gloref{espacoTens}, and each functional $\vtf{t}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ is said to be a \textsb{tensor}\index{tensor} of \textsb{order}\index{order!tensor} $m$, represented by \gloref{tensor}. In the particular case of $m=1$, a tensor space is considered to be a dual space, that is, $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U}=U^*_\mathcal{R}$, where a tensor is a linear functional. Moreover, it is possible to build particular tensor spaces from catersian powers together with dual spaces: a tensor space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{p}\times {V^*}^{q}}$, represented by \gloref{espacoTensTipo}, where $V^*_\mathcal{R}$ is the dual space of $V_\mathcal{R}$, is said to have a \textsb{contravariant order}\index{order!contravariant} $p$ and a \textsb{covariant order}\index{order!covariant} $q$ or we can call it a type $(p,q)$ tensor space.   

A tensor can be defined from the dual spaces of its constituent vector spaces, that is, a linear functional in each vector space $(U_i^*)_\mathcal{R}$ defines a multilinear functional (tensor) in $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$. Let's see how this happens. The tuple $(\vtf{g}_1,\cdots,\vtf{g}_m)$, which is an element of cartesian product $(U^*)^{\times m}=U^*_1\times\cdots\times U^*_m$, specifies a tensor in $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ when the following rule is defined: 
\begin{equation}
\fua{\tnr{G}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}=\prod_{i=1}^m\fua{\vtf{g}_i}{\vto{x}_i}\,,
\end{equation}
where tensor $\tnr{G}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ is classified dyadic\index{tensor!dyadic} if $m=2$, \textsb{triadic}\index{tensor!triadic} if $m=3$ and \textsb{polyadic}\index{tensor!polyadic} if $m>3$. Under these conditions, each linear functional $\vtf{g}_i$ is called \textsb{dyad}\index{dyad}, \textsb{triad}\index{triad} and \textsb{polyad}\index{polyad} respectively. In order to handle and make its polyads explict, the polyadic tensor that $(\vtf{g}_1,\cdots,\vtf{g}_m)$ defines we represent it by $\vtf{g}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{g}_m$, where symbol $\otimes$ is a function of two arguments, definer of a mapping called tensor product. In more formal and generic terms, considering tensor spaces $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}}$ and $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{W^{\times q}}$, a mapping $\map{\otimes}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}}\times\ete{\mathcal{R}}{W^{\times q}}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}\times W^{\times q}}}$ is called a \textsb{tensor product}\index{product!tensor} if, for all $\tnr{V}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}}$ and $\tnr{W}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{W^{\times q}}$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prodTens}
\fua{\tnr{V}\otimes\tnr{W}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_p,\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_q}=\fua{\tnr{V}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_p}\fua{\tnr{W}}{\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_q}\,,
\end{equation}
where tensor $\tnr{V}\otimes\tnr{W}:=\fua{\otimes}{\tnr{V},\tnr{W}}$ belongs to $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}\times W^{\times q}}$. From the following items, the representation of a polyadic tensor by a succession of tensor products, as is the case of $\vtf{g}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{g}_m$ above, results from the associativity property. Items
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{.1em}
\item[i.] Zero tensor: $\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{V}=\tnr{0} \implies\tnr{U}=\tnr{0}$ or $\tnr{V}=\tnr{0}$,
\item[ii.] Multiplication by scalar:\label{prop:TensMultScalar} $\alpha\tnr{U}\otimes\beta\tnr{V}=\alpha\beta(\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{V})=\beta\tnr{U}\otimes\alpha\tnr{V}$,
\item[iii.] Associativity:
$\lpa\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{V}\rpa\otimes\tnr{W}=\tnr{U}\otimes\lpa\tnr{V}\otimes\tnr{W}\rpa$,
\item[iv.] Left distributivity:
$\lpa\tnr{U}+\tnr{V}\rpa\otimes\tnr{W}=\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{W}+\tnr{V}\otimes\tnr{W}\,\,$ and
	\item[v.] Right distributivity:
	$\tnr{U}\otimes\lpa\tnr{V}+\tnr{W}\rpa=\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{V}+\tnr{U}\otimes\tnr{W}$
\end{itemize}
are valid properties for all $\alpha,\beta\in\mathcal{R}$ and  $\tnr{U},\tnr{V},\tnr{W}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$. Moreover, the following theorem states that a set of specific polyadic tensors, defined by tuples of coordinate functionals, is able to span a tensor space. 

\begin{mteo}{Basis of Polyadic Tensors}{geraEte}
Given a tensor space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ and a basis $B_i=\{\vto{u}_1^{(i)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{n_i}^{(i)}\}$ of each constituent vector space $(U_i)_\mathcal{R}$, $i=1,\cdots,m\,$, the set $B$ of all polyadic tensors $\vtf{f}_{j_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{j_m}^{B_m}$ is a basis of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, where coordinate functionals $\vtf{f}_{j_i}^{B_i}\in (U_i)_\mathcal{R}^*$, $j_i=1,\cdots,n_i\,$. 
\end{mteo}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Firstly, concerning the above properties of tensor products, each one can be verified from the definition \eqref{eq:prodTens} and from trivial multiplicative properties with scalars. About the theorem, we need to prove previously that if equalities $\tnr{T}_1({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})={\tnr{T}_2}(\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)})$, where $\tnr{T}_1,\tnr{T}_2\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, are valid, it results that $\tnr{T}_1=\tnr{T}_2$. In order to do that, we can say that 
\begin{align*}
\tnr{T}_1(\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m)&=\sum_{{j_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{j_m}=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{j_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_m}_{j_m}}{\vto{x}_m}\tnr{T}_1({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})\\
&=\sum_{{j_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{j_m}=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{j_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_m}_{j_m}}{\vto{x}_m}\tnr{T}_2({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})\\
&=\tnr{T}_2(\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m)\,,
\end{align*}
from which we conclude $\tnr{T}_1=\tnr{T}_2$. Now, let $\tnr{T}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ be a tensor where scalars $\beta_{i_1\cdots i_m}=\tnr{T}({\vto{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}})$ define a tensor 
\begin{equation*}
\tnr{X}=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n_m}\beta_{i_1\cdots i_m}\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{B_m}\,.
\end{equation*}
Thus we can write the following:
\begin{equation*}
\tnr{X}({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}}) = \sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n_m}\beta_{i_1\cdots i_m}\prod_{k=1}^m\delta_{i_kj_k}=\beta_{j_1\cdots j_m}=\tnr{T}({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})\,.
\end{equation*}
Such equalities enable us to conclude that $\tnr{X}=\tnr{T}$ and then $\spn{(B)}=\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, since $\tnr{T}$ is an arbitrary tensor of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$. Now we need to verify that if $B$ is linearly independent. This is true when coefficients $\alpha_{i_1\cdots i_m}$ of the linear combination 
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n_m}\alpha_{i_1\cdots i_m}\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{B_m}=\tnr{0}
\end{equation*}
are zero, which can be verified through the following development:  
\begin{align*}
\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n_m}\alpha_{i_1\cdots i_m}\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{B_m}({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})&=\tnr{0}({\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}})\\
\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n_m}\alpha_{i_1\cdots i_m}\prod_{k=1}^m\delta_{i_kj_k}&=0\\
\alpha_{j_1\cdots j_m}&=0
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
}

In the context of the above theorem, it can be noted that the number of polyadic tensors $\vtf{f}_{j_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{j_m}^{B_m}$ of basis $B$ is given by 
$n_1\cdots n_m$. Moreover, from the previous chapter, we already know that a vector space and its dual have the same dimension, that is, $\dim ((U_i)_\mathcal{R})=\dim ((U_i^*)_\mathcal{R})$. Thereby, we can state that the dimension of tensor space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ is the product of dimensions of each of vector spaces $(U_i)_\mathcal{R}$. In other words,
\begin{equation}
\dim (\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}) = \prod_{i=1}^m \dim ((U_i)_\mathcal{R})\,.
\end{equation}
Like any other basis of a vector space, each element of basis $B$ of tensor space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ also have a related coordinate functional, here represented by $\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots j_m}^{B}$. Thereby, given an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{T}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, the tuple constituted by scalars $\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots j_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})$, $j_i=1,\cdots,n_i\,$ is said to be the coordinates of $\tnr{T}$ on $B$. Using this definition, tensor $\tnr{T}$ can be described by expression 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tensCoord}
\tnr{T} = \sum_{k_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^{n_m} \vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\,\vtf{f}_{k_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{k_m}^{B_m}\,,
\end{equation}
from which the equalities   
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}} = \sum_{k_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^{n_m}\vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\,\prod_{i=1}^m \fua{\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{B_i}}{\vto{u}_{j_i}^{(i)}}=\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots j_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})
\end{equation*}
enable to define the following rule for coordinate functionals on basis $B$: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:regraCoordTens}
\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots j_m}^{B}(\tnr{X})= \fua{\tnr{X}}{\vto{u}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{u}_{j_m}^{(m)}}\,.
\end{equation}
In type $(p,q)$ tensor spaces, the coordinates of a tensor $\tnr{V}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{(p,q)}}$ are defined by scalars usually represented by 
\begin{equation}
(\vtf{f}^{Z})^{j_1\cdots j_p}_{k_1\cdots k_q}(\tnr{V}),\,\, j_i,k_l=1,\cdots,n\,,
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is a basis of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{(p,q)}}$, $i=1,\cdots,p$ and $l=1,\cdots,q\,\,$. The superscript indexes $j_i$ are related to space $V_\mathcal{R}$ of vectors whose coordinates are contravariant and the subscript indexes $k_l$ related to ${V}_\mathcal{R}^*$ of vectors whose coordinates are covariant. Tensors are called  \textsb{covariant}\index{tensor!covariant} or \textsb{contravariant}\index{tensor!contravariant} when they exclusively have covariant or contravariant indexes respectively and called \textsb{mixed}\index{tensor!mixed} when they have both. For $(p,q)$ tensor spaces, given a basis $W=\{\vto{w}_{1},\cdots,\vto{w}_{n}\}$ of $V_\mathcal{R}$, rule \eqref{eq:regraCoordTens} for coordinate functionals results   
\begin{equation}
(\vtf{f}^{Z})^{j_1\cdots j_p}_{k_1\cdots k_q}(\tnr{X})=\fua{\tnr{X}}{\vto{w}_{j_1},\cdots,\vto{w}_{j_p},\vtf{f}_{k_1}^{W},\cdots,\vtf{f}_{k_q}^{W}}\,,
\end{equation}
where bases  $W^*=\{\vtf{f}_{1}^{W},\cdots,\vtf{f}_{n}^{W}\}$ of $V_\mathcal{R}^*$ and $W^{**}=\{\vtf{f}_{1}^{W^*},\cdots,\vtf{f}_{n}^{W^*}\}$ of $V_\mathcal{R}^{**}$ define basis $Z$, in such a way that its elements have the format
\begin{equation}
\vtf{f}_{j_1}^{W}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{j_p}^{W}\otimes\vtf{f}_{k_1}^{W^*}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{k_q}^{W^*}\,,
\end{equation} 
according to theorem \ref{teo:geraEte}. In the context of Hilbert spaces, from the schematic figure \ref{fg:espacoDual}, we can affirm that $\vtf{f}_{j_i}^{W}=(\vto{w}^{j_i})^*$ and $\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{W^*}=(\vtf{f}^{W})^{k_i}=\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{W^\perp}=\vto{w}_{k_i}^*$. Thereby, the elements of $Z$ in this case have the classic format
\begin{equation}
(\vto{w}^{j_1})^*\otimes\cdots\otimes(\vto{w}^{j_p})^*\otimes\vto{w}_{k_1}^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{k_q}^*\,.
\end{equation} 


Since we just learned the rule to obtain the coordinates of a tensor on a certain basis, let's see how these coordinates behave when there is a change of basis. In the context of theorem \ref{teo:geraEte}, let $C_i=\{\vto{v}_1^{(i)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{n_i}^{(i)}\}$ be a basis of each vector space $(U_i)_\mathcal{R}$ and $\maf{\vtf{i}}{C_i}{B_i}$ a matrix that changes basis $B_i$ to basis $C_i$. From the rule \eqref{eq:regraCoordTens}, given a tensor 
$\tnr{T}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, we can develop the following:
\begin{align}
\fua{\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots j_m}^{C}}{\tnr{T}}&=\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{v}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{j_m}^{(m)}}  \nonumber\\
&=\sum_{k_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^{n_m} \vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\,\fua{\vtf{f}_{k_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{k_m}^{B_m}}{\vto{v}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{j_m}^{(m)}}\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{k_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^{n_m} \vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\,\prod_{i=1}^m\fua{\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{B_i}}{\vto{v}_{j_i}^{(i)}}\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{k_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^{n_m} \vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\,\prod_{i=1}^m\maf{\vtf{i}}{C_i}{B_i}_{k_ij_i}\,,
\end{align}
from which the last equality describes a change of coordinates of tensor $\tnr{T}$ from basis $B$ to basis $C$. Through this same process, it is possible to change the coordinates of a type $(p,q)$ tensor.  

\begin{comment}
Considering a tensor space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$, if its definer vector spaces $(U_i)_\mathcal{R}$ are Hilbert spaces, we can lay hands on the biunivocal relationship between elements $\vtf{f}_{j_i}^{B_i}$ of each dual basis $B_i^*$ and elements $(\vto{u}^{(i)})^{j_i}$ of each reciprocal basis $B^\perp_{i}$, as a consequence of Riesz-Fréchet Representation. Thereby, the polyadic tensors of basis $B$ are represented by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:poliadicoHilbert}
\vto{u}^{(1)}_{j_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}^{(m)}_{j_m}:=((\vto{u}^{(1)})^{j_1})^*\otimes\cdots\otimes((\vto{u}^{(m)})^{j_m})^*
\end{equation}
in order to simplify notation. If the constituent bases $B_i$ are orthonormal, then $B_i=B_i^\perp$ and  $((\vto{u}^{(i)})^{j_i})^*=(\vto{u}^{(i)}_{j_i})^*$ in the above definition. 
\end{comment}

A consequence of describing an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{T}$ as a linear combination of polyadic tensor elements of a certain basis is the possibility to arrange its coordinates in such a way that $\tnr{T}$ results an additive decomposition of polyadic tensors. In order to obtain this, let's betake the property of multiplication by scalars of tensor products\footnote{See p. \pageref{prop:TensMultScalar}.} and ``move'', during the $k_i$-th sum in \eqref{eq:tensCoord}, the coordinates $\vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_i\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})$ to multiply the coordinate functional $\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{B_i}$ of the $i$-th polyadic basis tensor, resulting in       
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decompAditTens}
\tnr{T} = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\underbrace{\sum_{k_i=1}^{n_i} \vtf{f}_{k_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes(\vtf{f}_{k_1\cdots k_i\cdots k_m}^{B}(\tnr{T})\vtf{f}_{k_i}^{B_i})\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{k_m}^{B_m}}_{(\vtf{t}_1)_i\otimes\cdots\otimes(\vtf{t}_m)_i}\,,
\end{equation}
where linear functional $(\vtf{t}_j)_i\in(U_j)_\mathcal{R}^*$ is the $j$-th polyad of the $i$-th polyadic tensor member of the additive decomposition of $\tnr{T}$. Moreover, if an arbitrary tensor can be decomposed as a sum of polyadic tensors and a sum of polyadic tensors  results in a polyadic tensor, since every tensor is a vector, we can state that \emph{every tensor can be described as a polyadic tensor}. For the previous case, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TensPoliadic}
\tnr{T}=\sum_{i=1}^m(\vtf{t}_1)_i\otimes\cdots\otimes(\vtf{t}_m)_i=\tnr{t}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{t}_m \,.
\end{equation} 


In the context of Hilbert spaces, if a tensor space has a unitary order, its tensors are covectors, that is, given an arbitrary vector $\vto{u}\in U_\mathcal{R}$, its covector $\vto{u}^*$ is a tensor of first order (linear functional), or $\vto{u}^*\in \ete{\mathcal{R}}{U}$. Moreover, if a scalar $\alpha$ belongs to a Hilbert space $\mathcal{R}_\mathcal{R}$, then covector $\alpha^*$ is defined to be a tensor of order zero. In other words, \emph{concerning tensor spaces defined by Hilbert spaces, covectors with a vector domain are first order tensors and covectors with a scalar domain are defined to be zeroth order tensors}. Now, given a tensor space $\ete{\real}{E^m}$, where $E_\real$ is a three-dimensional Euclidean space, let $\hat{B}$ be a basis whose $3^m$ elements have the format $\vun{e}_{j_1}^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vun{e}_{j_m}^*$, $j_i=1,2,3$. Thereby, we call \textsb{cartesian tensor}\index{tensor!cartesian} any linear combination of the elements of $\hat{B}$. 

The tensors of space $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{m}}$, $m>1$, can have the positions of their arguments interchanged, that is, given a tensor of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{2}}$, for example, arguments in $(\vto{x},\vto{y})$ can be changed to $(\vto{y},\vto{x})$, where $\vto{x},\vto{y}\in V_\mathcal{R}$. In this context, we say that a tensor $\tnr{T}_1$ is a permutation of tensor $\tnr{T}_2$ if $\fua{\tnr{T}_1}{\vto{x},\vto{y}}=\fua{\tnr{T}_2}{\vto{y},\vto{x}}$. In general terms, given a bijective mapping $\map{\pi}{\{ 1,\cdots,n \}}{\{1,\cdots,n \}}$, where the sets involved are constituted by ordinals, and a function $\pi$ called permutation of order $m$, in definition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:permutacaoTensor}
\fua{\tnr{T}_\pi}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_m}:=\tnr{T}\,(\vto{v}_{\fua{\pi}{1}},\cdots,\vto{v}_{\fua{\pi}{m}})\,,\forall\,
\vto{v}_i\in {V}_\mathcal{R}\,,
\end{equation}
the tensor $\tnr{T}_\pi\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{m}}$ is called the $\pi$ \textsb{permutation}\index{tensor!permutation of} of $\tnr{T}\in\tnr{V}^{m}_\mathcal{R}$. There are two important properties: a) the permutation of sum is the sum of permutations, that is, if $\tnr{T}=\tnr{A}+\tnr{B}$ then $(\tnr{A}+\tnr{B})_\pi=\tnr{A}_\pi+\tnr{B}_\pi$; b) tensor $(\alpha\tnr{T})_\pi=\alpha\tnr{T}_\pi$, $\forall\,\alpha\in\mathcal{R}$. Now, considering the specific rule $\fua{\pi}{x}=a\delta_{xb}+b\delta_{xa}+x(1-\delta_{xa}-\delta_{xb})$ that interchanges indexes $a$ and $b$, we call $\tnr{T}_\pi$ the $(a,b)$ \textsb{transposition}\index{tensor!transposition of} of $\tnr{T}$, represented by $\tnr{T}_{(a,b)}$.  



{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Let's verify the two properties above. As any other vector, a tensor can always be the result of a sum of tensors; thereby, from definition \eqref{eq:permutacaoTensor} and considering $\tnr{T}=\tnr{A}+\tnr{B}$, we have the following development:
\begin{align*}
\fua{(\tnr{A}+\tnr{B})_\pi}{\vto{u}_1,\cdots,\vto{u}_m}&=(\tnr{A}+\tnr{B})\,(\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{1}},\cdots,\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{m}})\nonumber\\
&=\tnr{A}\,(\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{1}},\cdots,\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{m}})+\tnr{B}\,(\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{1}},\cdots,\vto{u}_{\fua{\pi}{m}})\nonumber\\
&=\fua{\tnr{A}_\pi}{\vto{u}_1,\cdots,\vto{u}_m}+\fua{\tnr{B}_\pi}{\vto{u}_1,\cdots,\vto{u}_m}\nonumber\\
&=\fua{(\tnr{A}_\pi+\tnr{B}_\pi)}{\vto{u}_1,\cdots,\vto{u}_m}\,,
\end{align*}
from which we conclude that the permutation of sum is the sum of permutations. The proof of the second property follows this same process.
\end{proof}
}

The concept of permutation enables the concept of symmetry as follows: a tensor $\tnr{S}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{m}}$ is said to be \textsb{symmetric}\index{tensor!symmetric} if equality $\tnr{S}_\pi=\tnr{S}$ is valid for an arbitrary permutation $\pi$. Conversely, a tensor $\tnr{P}\in\tnr{V}^{m}_\mathcal{R}$ is called \textsb{antisymmetric}\index{tensor!antisymmetric} or \textsb{alternating}\index{tensor!alternating} if tensor $\tnr{P}_\pi=\epsilon_{\fua{\pi}{1}\cdots \fua{\pi}{m}}\,\tnr{P}$ for any $\pi$. Since $\tnr{P}$ is antisymmetric, we can conclude that scalar $\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}=0$ if $\vto{x}_a=\vto{x}_b$, where $\vto{x}_i\in V_\mathcal{R}$ and $a,b\in\{1,\cdots,m\}$. Thereby, the consequence is  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:igAntis}
\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_{i_1},\cdots,\vto{x}_{i_m}}=\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_m}\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, since the sum of two (anti)symmetric tensors is an (anti)symmetric tensor and multiplication by scalar also preserves (anti)symmetry, the set of all (anti)symmetric tensors defines a tensor subspace of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{m}}$. Then, it is possible, and intriguing, to obtain that \emph{every tensor subspace defined by antisymmetric tensors is one-dimensional.}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
First, let's prove \eqref{eq:igAntis}. If $\vto{x}_a=\vto{x}_b$, then 
\begin{align*}
\fua{\tnr{P}_\pi}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}&=\fua{\tnr{P}_\pi}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\\
\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_a\cdots i_b\cdots i_m}\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}&=\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_b\cdots i_a\cdots i_m}\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\\
\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}&=-\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\,,
\end{align*}
from which we conclude that $\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}=0$. From this result, if there is some index ${i_a}={i_b}$ in \eqref{eq:igAntis}, we obtain identity $0=0$. If all indexes are different, we can define the rule $\fua{\pi}{x}=i_x$, when equality results in the definition of antisymmetric tensor, that is, scalar
\begin{align*}
\tnr{P}({\vto{x}_{\fua{\pi}{1}},\cdots,\vto{x}_{\fua{\pi}{m}}})&=\epsilon_{\fua{\pi}{1}\cdots \fua{\pi}{m}}\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\\
\fua{\tnr{P}_\pi}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}&=\epsilon_{\fua{\pi}{1}\cdots \fua{\pi}{m}}\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\\
\tnr{P}_\pi&=\epsilon_{\fua{\pi}{1}\cdots \fua{\pi}{m}}\tnr{P}\,.
\end{align*}
Let's verify if (anti)symmetric tensors really define tensor subspaces. Let $\tnr{A}$ and $\tnr{B}$ be symmetric tensors of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{m}}$, where $\tnr{A}=\tnr{A}_\pi$ and $\tnr{B}=\tnr{B}_\pi$. Adding these equalities, we obtain $\tnr{A}+\tnr{B}=\tnr{A}_\pi+\tnr{B}_\pi=(\tnr{A}+\tnr{B})_\pi$, which shows that $\tnr{A}+\tnr{B}$ simétrico. This same process can be used for multiplication by scalar. Thereby, it is thus trivial to verify that a set of symmetric tensors observes the five definer axioms of vector spaces, presented in section \ref{sec:espacoVet}. In the case of antisymmetric tensors $\tnr{C}$ and $\tnr{D}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
	\epsilon_{\fua{\pi}{1}\cdots \fua{\pi}{m}}(\tnr{C}+\tnr{D})=\tnr{C}_\pi+\tnr{D}_\pi=(\tnr{C}+\tnr{D})_\pi\,,
\end{equation*}
which shows $\tnr{C}+\tnr{D}$ antisymmetric. Thereby, we can state that a set of antisymmetric tensors also defines a tensor space. Now, we'll verify the curious one-dimensionality of antisymmetric tensors by adapting to our case the idea of \aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1}, pp. 15-17. Let $\etn{\mathcal{R}}{V^m}\subset\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^m}$ be a tensor subspace of antisymmetric tensors, $B=\{\vto{v_1},\cdots,\vto{v}_n\}$ a basis of vector space $V_\mathcal{R}$ and an antisymmetric tensor  $\tnr{H}\in\etn{\mathcal{R}}{V^m}$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
\tnr{H}(\vto{x_1},\cdots,\vto{x}_m)=\sum_{i_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^n\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_m}}{\vto{x}_m}\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_m}\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\vto{x_i}\in V_\mathcal{R}$. This tensor $\tnr{H}$ is verified to be antisymmetric through the following development: 
\begin{align*}
\fua{\tnr{H}_{(a,b)}}{\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots}&=\cdots
\sum_{i_a=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_b=1}^n\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_a}}{\vto{x}_b}\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_b}}{\vto{x}_a}\cdots \,\epsilon_{\cdots i_a\cdots i_b\cdots}\\
&=\cdots
\sum_{i_b=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_a=1}^n\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_b}}{\vto{x}_b}\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_a}}{\vto{x}_a}\cdots \,\epsilon_{\cdots i_b\cdots i_a\cdots}\\
&=-\,\,\cdots
\sum_{i_b=1}^n\cdots\sum_{i_a=1}^n\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_b}}{\vto{x}_b}\cdots\,\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_a}}{\vto{x}_a}\cdots \,\epsilon_{\cdots i_a\cdots i_b\cdots}\\
&=\epsilon_{1\cdots b\cdots a\cdots m}\,\fua{\tnr{H}}{\cdots,\vto{x}_a,\cdots,\vto{x}_b,\cdots}\,
\end{align*}
where terms with indexes $i_1$ and $i_m$ are omitted and $a,b$ are arbitrary ordinals between $1$ and $m$. Considering an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{P}\in\etn{\mathcal{R}}{V^m}$, we know that
\begin{align*}
\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}&=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_m}}{\vto{x}_m}\tnr{P}({\vto{v}_{i_1},\cdots,\vto{v}_{i_m}})\\	&=\underbrace{\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n}\cdots\sum_{{i_m}=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B}_{i_m}}{\vto{x}_m}\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_m}}_{\tnr{H}(\vto{x_1},\cdots,\vto{x}_m)}\underbrace{\fua{\tnr{P}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_m}}_{\alpha}
\end{align*}
from which we conclude $\tnr{P}=\alpha\tnr{H}$, that is, $\{\tnr{H}\}$ is a basis of $\etn{\mathcal{R}}{V^m}$.
\end{proof}
}

Additionally to symmetric and antisymmetric, there is another notable tensor that will enable very important concepts for our study, like isotropy and anti-isotropy for example: I'm referring to the identity tensor, which is defined in tensor spaces of even order. We call \gloref{tensorI}$\,\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^{\times p}\times V^{\times p}}$ an \textsb{identity tensor}\index{tensor!identity} of order $2p$ if, given  a basis $B_i=\{\vto{v}_1^{(i)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{n_i}^{(i)}\}$ of $(V_\mathcal{R})_i$, scalars       
 \begin{equation}
 \fua{\tnr{I}}{\vto{v}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{i_p}^{(p)},\vto{v}_{j_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vto{v}_{j_p}^{(p)}}=\prod_{k=1}^p \delta_{i_kj_k}\,.
 \end{equation}
From this definition, considering $\vto{x}_i$ and $\vto{y}_i$ arbitrary vectors of $(V_\mathcal{R})_i$, we can write scalar $\fua{\tnr{I}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_p,\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_p}$ in the format 
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{{i_1,j_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_p,j_p}=1}^{n_p}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{i_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{j_1}}{\vto{y}_1}\cdots\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_p}_{i_p}}{\vto{x}_p}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_p}_{j_p}}{\vto{y}_p}\prod_{k=1}^p \delta_{i_kj_k}\,,
\end{equation*}
from which we conclude that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:identidade}
\fua{\tnr{I}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_p,\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_p}=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_p}=1}^{n_p}\,\prod_{k=1}^p\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_k}_{i_k}}{\vto{x}_k}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_k}_{i_k}}{\vto{y}_k}\,.
\end{equation}
This result enables us to consider
\begin{equation}
\tnr{I}=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{{i_p}=1}^{n_p}\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_p}^{B_p}\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_p}^{B_p}
\end{equation}
as an example of identity tensor. Moreover, in the context of tensor spaces $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{V^2}$, where $p=1$, defined by Euclidean spaces, we already know that, if basis $B_1$ is orthonormal, equality $\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{i_1}}{\vto{x}_1}\fua{\vtf{f}^\con{B_1}_{i_1}}{\vto{y}_1}=\vto{x}_1\cdot\vto{y}_1$ is valid, that is, expression \eqref{eq:identidade} results $\fua{\tnr{I}}{\vto{x}_1,\vto{y}_1}=\vto{x}_1\cdot\vto{y}_1$ and  
\begin{equation}
\tnr{I}=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\vun{v}_{i_1}\otimes\vun{v}_{i_1}=\sum_{{i_1}=1}^{n_1}\sum_{{j_1}=1}^{n_1}\delta_{i_1j_1}\vun{v}_{i_1}\otimes\vun{v}_{j_1}
\end{equation}
is an example of identity tensor of second order. From the last expression of these equalities, the coordinates of $\tnr{I}$ can be arranged in an identity matrix.  


\section{Tensor Functions}

For the purposes of our study, a tensor function establishes a functional relationship between tensors of any order. Because of this definition such functions in Hilbert spaces are of the most general type: as presented in the previous section, tensors of order zero are scalars by definition and tensors of first order are covectors, which are biunivocaly related to vectors, according to the Riesz-Fréchet Representation Theorem. In the context of Hilbert spaces, this generality of tensor functions is particularly  important for us and that is why we shall be dealing mostly with these spaces hereafter, betaking all their particularities. Therefore, considering these spaces, it is always possible to relate a multilinear function and a linear tensor function, which is a fundamental feature to enable uniqueness and existence of the specific linear tensor function to be presented in this section. The following theorem\footnote{Adapted from \aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1} after generalizing a property from  \aut{Marcus}\cite{marcus_1973_1}, p.14.}, borrowed from the realm of Multilinear Algebra, describes such feature by establishing a one to one correspondence between a multilinear function and a linear tensor function. From this biunivocal relationship, the multilinear function is usually said to be ``lifted'' to a tensor function.   

\begin{mteo}{Lifting of Multilinear Functions}{lift}
Considering function spaces $\evl{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}{V}$ and  $\evl{\mathcal{R}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}}{V}$, where sets $U_i$ and $V$ define Hilbert spaces, for every multilinear function  $\vtf{t}\in\evl{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}{V}$ there is one and only one linear tensor function $\vtf{t}^\otimes\in\evl{\mathcal{R}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}}{V}$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\vto{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_m^*}=\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\,,\,\,\forall\,\vto{x}_i\in U_i.
\end{equation*}
\end{mteo}
\hspace{1pt}
{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
The following proof is adapted from \aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1}, pp. 43-45. According to theorem \ref{teo:geraEte}, let $\tnr{X}\in\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ be an arbitrary tensor described by 
\begin{equation}
\tnr{X}=\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{B}}{\tnr{X}}\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{B_m}\,,
\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $B$ is a basis of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ defined by orthonormal bases  $\con{B}_i=\{\vun{u}_{1}^{(i)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{n_i}^{(i)}\}$ of $U_i$. According to rule \eqref{eq:regraOrtonmFunc}, the function $\vtf{t}^\otimes$ that observes $\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\vto{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_m^*}=\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}$ really exists and is uniquely determined by $\vtf{t}$, as can be verified in  
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\tnr{X}}&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_m}^{B}}{\tnr{X}}\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{B_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{B_m}}\nonumber\\
&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_m}^{B}}{\tnr{X}}\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
because the last equality results a rule for $\vtf{t}^\otimes$ since $\tnr{X}$ is arbitrary. Now, let's verify if equality $\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\vto{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_m^*}=\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}$ is valid. Considering $\tnr{X}=\vto{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_m^*$, equality \eqref{eq:conjMultFun}, the properties of complex conjugates and rule \eqref{eq:regraCoordTens}, the previous development can proceed as follows:  
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\vtf{t}^\otimes}{\vto{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_m^*}&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_m}^{B}}{\tnr{X}}\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\nonumber\\
&=&
\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\fua{\tnr{X}}{\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\nonumber\\
&=&
\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\prod_{k=1}^m \overline{\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_k}^{\con{B}_k}}{\vto{x}_k}}\,\,\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\nonumber\\
&=&
\fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{\con{B}_1}}{\vto{x}_1}
\vun{u}_{i_1}^{(1)},\cdots,\sum_{i_m=1}^{n_m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_m}^{\con{B}_m}}{\vun{x}_m}\vun{u}_{i_m}^{(m)}}\nonumber\\
&=& \fua{\overline{\vtf{t}}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\end{proof}
}

One of the special linear tensor functions mentioned in the previous paragraph, whose existence and uniqueness is assured by lifting multilinear functions, is called contraction. In simple words, this function relates a tensor of order $m$ and a tensor of order $m-p$, when we say that it ``contracts'' the order of its argument. Mathematically, in the context of the previous theorem, the tensor function $\vtf{c}_p^\otimes\in\evl{\mathcal{R}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m-p}}}$ is said to be a \textsb{contraction}\index{contraction} of order $p$ if it is lifted from $\tnr{c}_p\in\evl{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}{\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m-p}}}$ in such a way that the $(m-p)$-th order tensor
\begin{equation}
\fua{\vtf{c}_p^\otimes}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\overline{\vtf{c}}_p}{\vtf{x}_1,\cdots,\vtf{x}_m}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tnr{X}$ is an arbitrary element of $\ete{\mathcal{R}}{U^{\times m}}$ that can be described as a polyadic tensor $\vtf{x}_1^*\otimes\cdots\otimes\vtf{x}_m^*$, according to equalities \eqref{eq:TensPoliadic}. 

In our study, we deal with three different types of contraction, expressed by three different rules for $\overline{\vtf{c}}_p$. The first type is called trace of tensor, valid for tensor spaces of order greater than one and defined as follows. Still considering the above conditions, if $U^{\times m}=U_1\times\cdots\times U_{k_1}\times\cdots\times U_{k_2}\times\cdots\times U_m$ where $U_{k_1}=U_{k_2}$, the tensor $\fua{\vtf{c}_2^\otimes}{\tnr{X}}$ of order $m-2$ is a contraction called the $k_1,k_2$ trace of $\tnr{X}$, represented by $\trt{k_1}{k_2} \tnr{X}$, when 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lefteqn{\fua{\vtf{c}_2}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_m}:=} & & \nonumber\\
&
&\lpa
\vto{u}_r\cdot\vto{u}_s\rpa\vto{u}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_{r-1}\otimes\vto{u}_{r+1}
\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_{s-1}\otimes\vto{u}_{s+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_p\\
\end{eqnarray}

 



\subsubsection{Traço de Tensor}\index{traço!de tensor}
Seja o conjunto $\con{V}_{(p)}:=\crt{V}{p}$, onde $p\geq 2$, cujo
produto cartesiano contem pelo menos um par de conjuntos iguais.
Dado que $\con{V}_r=\con{V}_s$, $1\leq r < s \leq p$, seja o

diz-se que a contração $\vtf{c}_2^\otimes$, cujo valor

\subsection{Elevação}\index{Elevação}
A uma função multilinear qualquer $\vtf{g}$, cujos argumentos são
vetores, é sempre possível associar uma função linear
$\vtf{g}^\otimes$ que tem um tensor como argumento. Diz-se que
$\vtf{g}$ é ``elevada'' à $\vtf{g}^\otimes$. Esta
elevação\rodape{O termo em inglês é ``lifting''.} estabelece uma
conveniente e importante relação, descrita no teorema a seguir,
entre uma seqüência qualquer de vetores e um tensor. Fica
implícito que este teorema fundamenta questões de existência e
unicidade para os diversos tipos de funções tensoriais lineares a
serem apresentados nas seções subseqüentes.

\begin{teo}[Elevação]\index{Elevação!Teorema da}\label{teo:Lifting}
Sejam os espaços de Hilbert
$\ehr{V_1}{\con{F}},\cdots,\ehr{V_p}{\con{F}}$ e o espaço vetorial
$\evt{W}{\con{F}}$. Seja o espaço vetorial
$\evl{\crt{V}{p}}{W}{\con{F}}$ de funções multilineares que mapeiam uma tupla ordenada de vetores para um vetor de $\con{W}$ e
$\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{W}{\con{F}}$ o espaço vetorial
das funções lineares que mapeiam um tensor para um vetor de
$\con{W}$. Dada uma função qualquer
$\vtf{g}\in\cfl{\crt{V}{p}}{W}$ e uma tupla qualquer
$(\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p)\in\crt{V}{p}$, existe uma única
função $\vtf{g}^\otimes\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{W}$,
chamada função elevada de $\vtf{g}$, onde o vetor
\begin{equation}
\fua{\vtf{g}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}=\fua{\vtf{g}^\otimes}{\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p}.\nonumber
\end{equation}
\end{teo}
\begin{prova}\rodape{Adaptada de \aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1}, pp. 43-45.}
Seja um tensor qualquer $\tnr{T}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e
sua decomposição
\begin{equation}
\tnr{T}=\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_p}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\tnr{T}}{\vto{u}_{i_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{u}_{i_p}}^{(p)}\,,
\nonumber
\end{equation}
onde se considera
$\con{U}_i=\{{\vto{u}_{1}}^{(i)},\cdots,{\vto{u}_{n_i}}^{(i)}\}$
uma base de $\ehr{V_i}{\con{F}}$. A partir da igualdade deste
teorema, pode-se dizer que
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\vtf{g}^\otimes}{\tnr{T}}&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_p}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\tnr{T}}\fua{\vtf{g}^\otimes}{{\vto{u}_{i_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{u}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}\nonumber\\
&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_p}\underbrace{\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\tnr{T}}}\underbrace{\fua{\vtf{g}}{{\vto{u}_{i_1}}^{(1)},\cdots,{\vto{u}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}}\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Os termos destacados são unicamente determinados para qualquer
tensor $\tnr{T}$, logo $\vtf{g}^\otimes$ existe e fica unicamente
determinado. A fim de constatar a igualdade do teorema, seja
\begin{equation}
\tnr{T}=\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p\,.\nonumber
\end{equation}
Do resultado do desenvolvimento anterior, considerando as propriedades de funções multilineares e a
proposição \ref{prp:produtorioFuncionais}, tem-se que
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\vtf{g}^\otimes}{\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p}&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_p}
\prod_{k=1}^p \fua{\vtf{f}_{i_k}^{\con{U}_k}}{\vto{v}_k}
\fua{\vtf{g}}{{\vto{u}_{i_1}}^{(1)},\cdots,{\vto{u}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}\nonumber\\
&=&
\fua{\vtf{g}}{\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1}^{\con{U}_1}}{\vto{v}_1}
{\vto{u}_{i_1}}^{(1)},\cdots,\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_p}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_p}^{\con{U}_p}}{\vto{v}_p}{\vto{u}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}\nonumber\nonumber\\

\end{eqnarray}

função elevada de
$\vtf{c}_n\in\cfl{\con{V}_{(p)}}{\cft{\con{V}_{(p-n)}}{\con{F}}}$,
representada $\vtf{c}_n^{\otimes}$, é uma função tensorial linear
denominada contração de ordem $n$. A partir do teorema
\ref{teo:Lifting}, dado um tensor qualquer
$\tnr{T}\in\cft{\con{V}_{(p)}}{\con{F}}$ com decomposição
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decomposicaoTensor}
\tnr{T}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{v}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_{pk}\,,\,
m\geq 1,
\end{equation}
tem-se que o tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:elevadaTensor}
\fua{\vtf{c}_n^\otimes}{\tnr{T}}=\sum_{k=1}^m\fua{\vtf{c}_n}{\vto{v}_{1k},\cdots,\vto{v}_{pk}}
\end{equation}
e sua ordem é $p-n$.

\subsubsection{Traço de Tensor}\index{traço!de tensor}
Seja o conjunto $\con{V}_{(p)}:=\crt{V}{p}$, onde $p\geq 2$, cujo

conjunto
\begin{equation}
\con{V}_{(p-2)}:=\con{V}_1\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{r-1}\times\con{V}_{r+1}
\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{s-1}\times\con{V}_{s+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_p\,.
\end{equation}
Com base nos espaços $\ete{\con{V}_{(p)}}{\con{F}}$,
$\ete{\con{V}_{(p-2)}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\evl{\con{V}_{(p)}}{\cft{\con{V}_{(p-2)}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}$,
diz-se que a contração $\vtf{c}_2^\otimes$, cujo valor

\subsubsection{Produto Contrativo}\index{produto!contrativo}
Sejam os produtos cartesianos $\con{W}=\crt{W}{t}\times\crt{V}{s}$
e $\con{Z}=\crt{V}{s}\times\crt{Z}{m}$, a partir dos quais se
estabelece que $\con{V}_{(p)}:=W\times\con{Z}$, $p=t+2s+m$. Seja,
então, o conjunto
\begin{eqnarray}
\lefteqn{\con{V}_{(p-2q)}:=} & & \nonumber\\
& &
\con{W}_1\times\cdots\con{W}_t\times\con{V}_{q+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{s}\times\con{V}_{q+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{s}\times\con{Z}_1\times\cdots\times\con{Z}_m\,,\nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
resultante da retirada dos primeiros $q$ pares de conjuntos iguais
em $\con{V}_{(p)}$. Seja a contração $\vtf{c}_{2q}^\otimes$ tal
que

\lefteqn{\fua{\vtf{c}_{2q}}{\vto{w}_1,\cdots,\vto{w}_t,\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_s,\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_s,\vto{z}_1,\cdots,\vto{z}_m}:=} & & \nonumber\\

& & \vto{y}_{q+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_{s}
\otimes\vto{z}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{z}_m\,,
\end{eqnarray}
onde $\vto{w}_i\in\con{W}_i$, $\vto{x}_j,\vto{y}_j\in\con{V}_j$,
$\vto{z}_k\in\con{W}_k$. Considerando os tensores quaisquer
$\tnr{W}\in\cft{\con{W}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\tnr{Z}\in\cft{\con{Z}}{\con{F}}$ com decomposições
\begin{equation}
\tnr{W}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{tk}\otimes
\vto{x}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_{qk},\,\vto{w}_{ik}\in\con{W}_i,\,\vto{x}_{jk}\in\con{V}_j,
\end{equation}
e
\begin{equation}
\tnr{Z}=\sum_{k=1}^n\vto{y}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_{tk}\otimes
\vto{z}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{z}_{qk},\,\vto{y}_{ik}\in\con{V}_i,\,\vto{z}_{jk}\in\con{Z}_j,
\end{equation}
tem-se, segundo (\ref{eq:elevadaTensor}), o tensor de ordem $p-2q$
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:funcaoContrativoTensorial}
\lefteqn{\fua{\vtf{c}_{2q}^\otimes}{\tnr{W}\otimes\tnr{Z}}=} & & \nonumber\\
& &\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^n\lpa

\end{eqnarray}
A função no mapeamento
$\map{\odot_q}{\cft{\con{W}}{\con{F}}\times\cft{\con{Z}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{V}_{(p-2q)}}{\con{F}}}$,
onde
\begin{equation}\label{eq:produtoContrativo}
\tnr{W}\odot_q\tnr{Z}:=\fua{\vtf{c}_{2q}^\otimes}{\tnr{W}\otimes\tnr{Z}},
\end{equation}
é denominada produto contrativo de ordem $q$. Para este produto,
são válidas as igualdades:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] $\tnr{W}\odot_0\tnr{Z}=\tnr{W}\otimes\tnr{Z}$;
\item[ii.] Bilinearidade: dados
$\tnr{Z}_1,\tnr{Z}_2\in\cft{\con{Z}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\ele{a},\ele{b}_1,\ele{b}_2\in\con{F}$ quaisquer,
\begin{equation}
\lpa\ele{a}\tnr{W}\rpa\odot_q\lpa\ele{b}_1\tnr{Z}_1+\ele{b}_2\tnr{Z}_2\rpa=\ele{a}\ele{b}_1\lpa
\tnr{W}\odot_q\tnr{Z}_1\rpa+\ele{a}\ele{b}_2\lpa
\tnr{W}\odot_q\tnr{Z}_2\rpa.\nonumber
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Além destas propriedades, o produto contrativo pode ser
associativo. Sejam os tensores $\tnr{Y}\in\cft{\con{Y}}{\con{F}}$
e $\tnr{K}\in\cft{\con{K}}{\con{F}}$, onde
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\con{Y}&=&\con{V}_1\times\cdots\con{V}_s\times\con{Y}_1\times\cdots\times\con{Y}_u\times\con{W}_1\times\cdots\times\con{W}_m,\\
\con{K}&=&\con{W}_1\times\cdots\con{W}_m\times\con{K}_1\times\cdots\times\con{K}_n.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Nestas condições, tem-se associatividade:
\begin{itemize}
\item[iii.]
$\tnr{W}\odot_q\lpa\tnr{Y}\odot_r\tnr{K}\rpa=\lpa\tnr{W}\odot_q\tnr{Y}\rpa\odot_r\tnr{K}$,
onde $q\leqslant s$ e $r\leqslant m$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Produto Interno.} Considerando o produto cartesiano $\crt{V}{s}$,
o produto contrativo $\tnr{T}_1\odot_s\tnr{T}_2$, onde
$\tnr{T}_1,\tnr{T}_2\in\cft{\crt{V}{s}}{\con{F}}$, representado na
forma $\tnr{T}_1\odot\tnr{T}_2$, torna-se o produto interno
positivo-definido entre $\tnr{T}_1$ e $\tnr{T}_2$, pois a função
$\odot$ define o mapeamento
$\map{\odot}{\crt{V}{s}\times\crt{V}{s}}{\con{\con{F}}}$,
obedecendo as propriedades apresentadas na seção
\ref{subsec:EspacoProdutoInterno}. Na prática, a notação é
alterada para $\tnr{T}_1\cdot\tnr{T}_2$ se $s=1$, para
$\tnr{T}_1:\tnr{T}_2$  se $s=2$, para $\tnr{T}_1\cdot:\tnr{T}_2$
se $s=3$, para $\tnr{T}_1::\tnr{T}_2$ se $s=4$, etc...

Diz-se então que $\ete{\crt{V}{s}}{\con{F}}$ é um \emph{espaço
tensorial produto interno}\index{espaço!tensorial!produto
interno}. Caso sejam definidas uma métrica e uma norma para este
espaço, pode-se ter, de forma similar ao caso de espaços
vetoriais, \emph{espaços tensoriais de Banach e Hilbert}.


\subsection{Operador Tensorial Identidade}\index{operador!tensorial!identidade} Seja um espaço tensorial

\end{equation}
é identidade se sua regra for descrita por
\begin{equation}
\fua{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{X}\,.
\end{equation}
Desta forma, fica evidente que $\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ define um
mapeamento bijetor.

Seja uma base qualquer de tensores poliádicos

gerada pela base $\con{U}_i=\{ {\vto{v}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots,
{\vto{v}_{n_p}}^{(i)}\}$ de $\ehr{V_i}{\con{F}}$. Tomando o array
associado a $\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ na base
$\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ e utilizando a proposição
\ref{prp:produtorioFuncionais}, pode-se realizar o seguinte
desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lco{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}_{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}_{i_1\cdots
i_pj_1\cdots j_p}&=&\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\fua{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{{\vto{v}_{j_1}}^{(1)}

&=&\prod_{k=1}^p \lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{V_k}\rpa_{U_k}\rco^{U_k}_{i_k
j_k}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
É possível obter que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hiperdertIdentidade}
\hpd{\lco{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}_{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}}=
\prod_{k=1}^p\det{\lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{V_k}\rpa_{U_k}\rco^{U_k}}=1\,.
\end{equation}

e
$\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}$.
Dada a função tensorial identidade
\begin{equation}
\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
denomina-se a função
\begin{equation}
\psi^{-1}\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\nonumber
\end{equation}
de função inversa de
\begin{equation}
\psi\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}\nonumber

se
\begin{equation}
\psi\circ\psi^{-1} = \vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\,.

e $\con{Z}_i=\{ {\vto{w}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots,

bases de tensores poliádicos
$\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ e

espaço vetorial de funções tensoriais lineares
$\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}$,
diz-se que o operador tensorial

\end{equation}
é uma função linear que promove uma mudança de base de
$\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ para
$\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$. Com base no
desenvolvimento que resulta (\ref{eq:arrayFuncaoTensorial}) e na
proposição \ref{prp:produtorioFuncionais}, pode-se realizar o
seguinte:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lco\varsigma_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}_{i_1\cdots
i_pj_1\cdots j_p}&=&\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\fua{\varsigma}{{\vto{v}_{j_1}}^{(1)}
\otimes\cdots\otimes {\vto{v}_{j_p}}^{(p)}}}\nonumber\\
&=&\prod_{k=1}^p
\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_k}^{\con{Z}_k}}{{\vto{w}_{j_k}}^{(k)}}\nonumber\\
&=&\prod_{k=1}^p \lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{V_k}\rpa_{Z_k}\rco^{Z_k}_{i_k
j_k}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Logo
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mudancaBaseIdentidade}
\lco\varsigma_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}=
\lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa_{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\,.
\end{equation}
Utilizando procedimento semelhante, obtém-se as igualdades:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lco\varsigma_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa_{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\,;\\
\lco{\varsigma^{-1}}_{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\,;\\
\lco{\varsigma^{-1}}_{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\lco\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\,.
\end{eqnarray}

Dado um operador tensorial qualquer
$\psi\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$,
a partir dos arrays associados à $\varsigma$ e a funções
tensoriais compostas, pode-se deduzir facilmente as seguintes
conversões:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conversoesTensores}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mas{\psi}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\psi}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\\
\mas{\psi}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\psi}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\\
\mas{\psi}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\psi}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\\
\mas{\psi}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}&=&
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\psi}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\mas{\lpa\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\rpa}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Seguindo procedimento semelhante, as demais conversões entre os
arrays associados a $\psi$ podem ser construídas alternando-se
convenientemente as bases dos termos à direita da igualdade.



\subsection{Função Tensorial Transposta}\index{função!tensorial!transposta}\label{sec:funcaoTensorialTransposta}
Sejam os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, $\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e os
tensores quaisquer $\tnr{X}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
$\tnr{Y}\in\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$. Dados os espaços vetoriais de funções tensoriais
\begin{eqnarray}
\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}&\mathrm{e}&
\evl{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}},\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
denomina-se função tensorial transposta de
\begin{equation}
{\psi}\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}\nonumber
\end{equation}
à única função tensorial
\begin{equation}
{\psi}^T\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\nonumber
\end{equation}
que promove
\begin{equation}\label{eq:funcaoTensorialTransposta}
\fua{\psi}{\tnr{X}}\odot\tnr{Y}=\tnr{X}\odot\fua{\psi^T}{\tnr{Y}}\,.
\end{equation}
Se $\crt{V}{p}=\crt{W}{q}$ e $\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ for uma base de $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, pode-se demonstrar facilmente que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:arrayfunTensorialBaseSimetrica}
{ \mas{\psi}{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}^T=
\mas{\psi}{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\,.
\end{equation}

Caso os espaços tensoriais considerados forem de Euclidianos, dadas duas bases $\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{\times p}}$ e
$\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{\times q}}$ de $\ete{\crt{V}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ respectivamente, pode-se demonstrar por processo similar à obtenção do resultado (\ref{eq:matrizfunTransposta}) que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:arrayfunTensorialTransposta}
{ \mas{\psi}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{W}{q}}}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}^T=
\mas{\psi^T}{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{W}{q}}}\,.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Operador Tensorial Simétrico}\index{operador!tensorial!simétrico}
Considerando as condições anteriores, tendo
$\crt{W}{q}=\crt{V}{p}$, um operador tensorial $\psi$ é simétrico
se $\psi=\psi^T$. Ele é
\emph{anti-simétrico}\index{operador!tensorial!anti-simétrico} se
$\psi=-\psi^T$.

\subsubsection{Operador Tensorial Ortogonal}\index{operador!tensorial!ortogonal}
Para $\crt{W}{q}=\crt{V}{p}$, a função $\psi$ é um operador
tensorial ortogonal se
\begin{equation}
\psi^{-1}=\psi^T\,.
\end{equation}
A partir de (\ref{eq:funcaoTensorialTransposta}), similarmente ao
desenvolvimento (\ref{eq:preservaProdInterno}), pode-se demonstrar
que funções tensoriais ortogonais preservam a operação produto
interno $\odot$.

Com base na definição de grupo ortogonal apresentada na seção
\ref{sec:Transposicao}, pode-se dizer que o subconjunto
$\con{O}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ de
$\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$,
formado somente por operadores tensoriais ortogonais, define
$\gro{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$. Os subconjuntos
$\con{O}^+_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ e
$\con{O}^-_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ de
$\con{O}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, compostos por operadores
ortogonais próprios e impróprios respectivamente, geram os grupos
ortogonais $\grr{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ e
$\gri{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,$.

\section{A Relação Tensor e Função Tensorial Linear}

Conforme o teorema apresentado a seguir, pode-se estabelecer uma
relação bijetora entre um tensor e uma função tensorial linear,
generalizando a relação descrita no teorema
\ref{teo:RepresentacaoRiesz}.
\begin{teo}[Riesz Generalizado]\label{teo:RieszGeneralizado}
Sejam os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
$\ete{\con{U}_e}{\con{F}}$, $\ete{\con{W}_e}{\con{F}}$,
$\ete{\con{U}_d}{\con{F}}$ e $\ete{\con{W}_d}{\con{F}}$, tais que
$\crt{V}{p}=\con{U}_e\times\con{W}_e=\con{W}_d\times\con{U}_d$.
Desta forma, dado um escalar $q\,$, $1\leqslant q \leqslant p\,$, sejam
os produtos cartesianos
\begin{eqnarray}
\con{U}_e:=\crt{V}{q}\,, &&
\con{W}_e:=\con{V}_{q+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{p}\,,
\nonumber\\
\con{U}_d:=\con{V}_{p-q+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{p}\,, &&
\con{W}_d:=\crt{V}{p-q}\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Sejam os espaços vetoriais
\begin{eqnarray}
\evl{\cft{\con{U}_e}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_e}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}&e&
\evl{\cft{\con{U}_d}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_d}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Dado um tensor qualquer $\tnr{T}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
sejam as funções tensoriais lineares
\begin{eqnarray}
{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}_{\tnr{T}}\in\cfl{\cft{\con{U}_e}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_e}{\con{F}}}&e&
\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}\in\cfl{\cft{\con{U}_d}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_d}{\con{F}}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
definidas pelas regras
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{T}&e&\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{Y}}=\tnr{T}\odot_q\tnr{Y}.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Os mapeamentos
\begin{eqnarray}
\map{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cfl{\cft{\con{U}_e}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_e}{\con{F}}}}&e&
\map{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cfl{\cft{\con{U}_d}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_d}{\con{F}}}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
são transformações lineares bijetoras se, respectivamente,
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}}=\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}&e&\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}}=\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\end{teo}
\begin{prova}
A demonstração deste teorema se processa de maneira similar à do
teorema \ref{teo:RepresentacaoRiesz}, ou seja, dados
$\tnr{T}_1,\tnr{T}_2\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\alpha,\beta\in\con{F}$ quaisquer, constata-se que
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] $\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}$ é uma função linear:
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\alpha\tnr{T}_1+\beta\tnr{T}_2}}{\tnr{X}}&=
&\tnr{X}\odot_q\lpa\alpha\tnr{T}_1+\beta\tnr{T}_2\rpa\nonumber\\
&=&\alpha\lpa\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{T}_1\rpa+\beta\lpa\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{T}_2\rpa\nonumber\\
&=&\alpha\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_1}}{\tnr{X}}+\beta\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_2}}{\tnr{X}}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\lco\alpha\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_1}
+\beta\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_2}\rco}{\tnr{X}}\nonumber\\
\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\alpha\tnr{T}_1+\beta\tnr{T}_2}&=&\alpha\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_1}
+\beta\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}_2}\nonumber\\
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\alpha\tnr{T}_1+\beta\tnr{T}_2}&=&\alpha\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_1}+\beta\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_2}\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\item[ii.] $\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}$ define um mapeamento
injetor:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lco\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_1}\rco\lpa\tnr{X}\rpa&=&\lco\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_2}\rco\lpa\tnr{X}\rpa\nonumber\\
\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{T}_1&=&\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{T}_2\nonumber\\
\tnr{X}\odot_q\lpa\tnr{T}_1-\tnr{T}_2\rpa&=&\negmath{0}\nonumber\\
\tnr{T}_1&=&\tnr{T}_2\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\item[iii.] $\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}$ define um mapeamento
sobrejetor: dada uma função
$\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}\in\cfl{\cft{\con{U}_e}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\con{W}_e}{\con{F}}}$
qualquer, uma base $\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{q}}$ formada pelos
conjuntos $\{ {\vto{v}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots, {\vto{v}_{n_i}}^{(i)}\}$
e um tensor
\begin{equation}
\tnr{Z}=\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_q=1}^{n_q}{\vto{v}_{i_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{i_q}}^{(q)}
\otimes\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}{{\vto{v}_{i_1}^*}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{i_q}^*}^{(q)}}\,,
\nonumber
\end{equation}
pode-se dizer que
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{Z}}}{\tnr{X}}&=&\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{Z}\nonumber\\
&=&\lpa\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_q}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{q}}}}{\tnr{X}}{\vto{v}_{i_1}^*}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{i_q}^*}^{(q)}\rpa
\odot_q\nonumber\\
&&\lpa\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{j_q=1}^{n_q}{\vto{v}_{j_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{j_q}}^{(q)}
\otimes\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}{{\vto{v}_{j_1}^*}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{j_q}^*}^{(q)}}\rpa\nonumber\\
&=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{n_q}\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{j_q=1}^{n_q}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{q}}}}{\tnr{X}}\delta_{i_1j_1}\cdots\delta_{i_qj_q}
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}{{\vto{v}_{j_1}^*}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{j_q}^*}^{(q)}}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}{\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1}\cdots\sum_{j_q=1}^{n_q}\fua{\vtf{f}_{j_1\cdots
j_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{q}}}}{\tnr{X}}
{\vto{v}_{j_1}^*}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{j_q}^*}^{(q)}}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}\nonumber\\
\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{Z}}&=&\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}\nonumber\,.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}
A demonstração para a função $\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}$ segue
esta mesma metodologia.
\end{prova}


\begin{prp}\label{prp:propsRieszGeneralizado}
Considerando as condições do teorema \ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado},
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] se $q=p$, então $\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi} \,=\,
\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}$ ;

\item[ii.] se $2q=p$, os tensores $\tnr{X}$, $\tnr{Y}$,
$\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{X}}$ e
$\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{Y}}$ possuem
ordens iguais;

\item[iii.] se $2q=p$ e $\con{V}_1=\cdots=\con{V}_p$, as funções
$\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}$ e
$\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}$ são operadores lineares;

\item[iv.] Dada uma tupla qualquer
$(\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p)\in\crt{V}{p}$, é sempre válido que
\begin{equation}
\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}=\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_q}
\odot\lpa\vto{v}_{q+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p\rpa\nonumber
\end{equation}
e
\begin{equation}
\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}=\lpa\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_{p-q}\rpa\odot
\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\vto{v}_{p-q+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p}\,.\nonumber
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\end{prp}
\begin{prova}
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] Se $q=p$, então
$\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\tnr{X}}$,
$\forall\, \tnr{X}$;

\item[ii.] Facilmente comprovada pelas condições do teorema
\ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}.


\item[iii.] Facilmente comprovada pelas condições do teorema
\ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}.


\item[iv.] Considerando
\begin{equation}
\tnr{T}=\sum_{i=1}^m\vto{u}_{1i}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_{pi}\,,\,
m\geq 1\nonumber
\end{equation}
e a igualdade (\ref{eq:produtorioPoliadico}), fica evidente que
\begin{equation}
\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}=\tnr{T}\odot
\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p\,.\nonumber
\end{equation}
Pode-se fazer, então, o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\tnr{T}}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}&=&\fua{\lco
\sum_{i=1}^m\vto{u}_{1i}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_{pi}
\rco}{\vto{v}_1,\cdots,\vto{v}_p}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\lco\sum_{i=1}^m
\lpa\vto{u}_{1i}\cdot\vto{v}_{1}\rpa\cdots\lpa\vto{u}_{qi}\cdot\vto{v}_{q}\rpa
 \vto{u}_{q+1i}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{u}_{pi}
\rco}{\vto{v}_{q+1},\cdots,\vto{v}_p}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\lco\lpa\vto{v}_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_{q}\rpa\odot_q\tnr{T}\rco}{\vto{v}_{q+1},\cdots,\vto{v}_p}\nonumber\\
&=&\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}}{\vto{v}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_q}\odot\lpa\vto{v}_{q+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_p\rpa\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Utiliza-se o procedimento semelhante para a igualdade com
$\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{prova}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:funcaoLinearETensores}
Sejam os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, $\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e
\begin{equation}
\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}\,.\nonumber
\end{equation}
Dados os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e $\ete{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$, uma função qualquer
\begin{equation}
\psi\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}\,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
nos termos do teorema \ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}, está sempre associada a um e somente um tensor de $\cft{\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e de
$\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ respectivamente.
\end{prp}
\begin{prova}
Com base no teorema \ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}, há um único tensor
$\tnr{T}_1\in\cft{\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ associado à função $\psi$, devido
a igualdade $\fua{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_1}=\psi$, onde
$\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\Psi}$ é uma bijeção. Da mesma forma, segundo este mesmo teorema,
existe um único $\tnr{T}_2\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ associado a
$\psi$, via $\fua{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\Psi}}{\tnr{T}_2}=\psi$.
\end{prova}

\subsection{Funções Representantes}\index{função!representante} A relação entre funções
lineares e vetores descrita no teorema \ref{teo:RepresentacaoRiesz} permite substituir a
notação da função $\vartheta_{\vto{v}}$ para simplesmente $\vto{v}$, de onde se diz que
um vetor pode também ser considerado um funcional linear, conforme
(\ref{eq:VetorFuncional}).

No caso de tensores, segundo o teorema
\ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}, as funções
$\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}$ e
$\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}$ têm, cada uma, relação
bijetora com o tensor $\tnr{T}$. Com base nisso, as funções
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:funcaoTensorial}
\rft{T}{q}\,:=\,\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}&\mathrm{e}&
\lft{T}{q}\,:=\,\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\psi}_{\tnr{T}}
\end{eqnarray}
são chamadas funções representantes do tensor $\tnr{T}$ com
contração $q$ à direita e à esquerda, respectivamente. Se o tensor
$\tnr{T}$ tiver ordem $p$, $\rft{T}{q}$ e $\lft{T}{q}$ são funções
tensoriais lineares associadas a $\tnr{T}$, segundo
(\ref{eq:funcaoTensorial}), cujas imagens são constituídas por
tensores de ordem $p-q$. Pode-se concluir, então, que
$\vartheta_{\vto{v}}$ é uma função representante de $\vto{v}$ com
contração 1 à direita ou à esquerda.

O teorema \ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado} é de fundamental
importância, já que ele torna possível apresentar o estudo de
tensores como o estudo de uma de suas funções representantes. A
livre escolha de uma delas, no entanto, determina qual das duas
igualdades do ítem iv da proposição
\ref{prp:propsRieszGeneralizado} é considerada\rodape{Grande parte
dos trabalhos em Mecânica do Contínuo que tratam de Teoria de
Tensores não mostra, de forma explícita, qual das funções
representantes é utilizada para substituir o conceito de tensor.
No caso de tensores de segunda ordem, por exemplo, a clássica
apresentação do produto tensorial $\vto{v}\otimes\vto{w}$ como
sendo uma função que mapeia o vetor $\vto{x}$ para o vetor
$(\vto{w}\cdot\vto{x})\vto{v}$ revela, implicitamente, a opção
pela função representante com contração 1 à direita.}.

De agora em diante, toda vez que conceitos baseados em funções
representantes forem independentes da abordagem de representação
previamente escolhida (com contração à direita ou à esquerda),
será utilizada a notação sem seta $\ftr{T}{q}\,$.

\subsubsection{Função Representante Identidade}\index{função!representante!identidade}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$. A partir da
igualdade (\ref{eq:tensorIdentidade}) que define o tensor identidade de
$\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, para quaisquer
$\vto{x}_i,\vto{y}_i\in\con{V}_i$, pode-se realizar o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\tnr{I}}{\vto{x}_1,\cdots,\vto{x}_p,\vto{y}_1,\cdots,\vto{y}_p}&=&
\lpa\vto{x}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_p\rpa\odot
\lpa\vto{y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_p\rpa\nonumber\\
&=& \lpa\vto{x}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_p\rpa\odot\lco
\fua{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\vto{y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_p}\rco\nonumber\\
&=&
\lco\fua{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}{\vto{x}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_p}\rco\odot
\lpa\vto{y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_p\rpa\nonumber\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Com base no ítem iv da proposição
\ref{prp:propsRieszGeneralizado}, pode-se concluir então que a
função representante identidade
\begin{equation}\label{eq:funRepresentanteIdentidade}
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\rft{I}{p}&=&\lft{I}{p}&=&\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}\,\,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Funções Representantes e Tensor Identidade}
Sejam os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
$\ete{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\ete{\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$. Considerando um base
genérica qualquer $\con{U}_i=\{ {\vto{u}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots, {\vto{u}_{n_i}}^{(i)}\}$ de
$\ehr{V_i}{\con{F}}$, todo tensor identidade assume uma das formas
(\ref{eq:TensorIdentidadeExplicito1}) ou (\ref{eq:TensorIdentidadeExplicito2}). Neste
contexto, se $\tnr{I}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
$\tnr{A}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\tnr{B}\in\cft{\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, onde
\begin{equation}
\tnr{A}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{x}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_{pk}\otimes
\vto{y}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_{pk}\otimes\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{qk}
\end{equation}
e
\begin{equation}
\tnr{B}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{qk}\otimes
\vto{x}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{x}_{pk}\otimes\vto{y}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{y}_{qk}\,,
\end{equation}
$m\geq 1$, então
\begin{equation}\label{eq:funcaRepresentanteXIdentidade}
\fua{\lft{A}{2p}}{\tnr{I}}=\fua{\rft{B}{2p}}{\tnr{I}}=\sum_{k=1}^m\prod_{i=1}^{p}\vto{x}_{ik}\cdot\vto{y}_{ik}
\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{qk}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Função Representante Composta}\index{função!representante!composta} Dado o
espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e os tensores quaisquer
$\tnr{A}$,$\tnr{B}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, onde $p\geqslant s+q$, tal que $s$ e $q$
são escalares positivos não nulos. Das definições (\ref{eq:funcaoTensorial}), dado um
tensor qualquer $\tnr{X}\in\cft{\crt{V}{q}}{\con{F}}$, fica evidente que
\begin{equation}
\fua{\rft{A}{s}}{\fua{\rft{B}{q}}{\tnr{X}}}=\tnr{A}\odot_s\lpa\tnr{B}\odot_q\tnr{X}\rpa
\end{equation}
e
\begin{equation}
\fua{\lft{A}{s}}{\fua{\lft{B}{q}}{\tnr{X}}}=\lpa\tnr{X}\odot_q\tnr{B}\rpa\odot_s\tnr{A}\,.
\end{equation}
Nestas condições, o produto contrativo é associativo, logo
\begin{equation}\label{eq:represCompostaDireita}
\rft{A}{s}\circ\rft{B}{q}=\lpa\tnr{A}\odot_s\tnr{B}\rpa\rft{}{q}
\end{equation}
e
\begin{equation}\label{eq:represCompostaEsquerda}
\lft{A}{s}\circ\lft{B}{q}=\lpa\tnr{B}\odot_s\tnr{A}\rpa\lft{}{q}\,.
\end{equation}
Nos casos onde $q=s$, costuma-se utilizar as seguintes
representações:
\begin{eqnarray}
\rft{AB}{q}&:=&\lpa\tnr{A}\odot_q\tnr{B}\rpa\rft{}{q}\,\,,\label{eq:funRepCompostaDireita}\\
\lft{AB}{q}&:=&\lpa\tnr{B}\odot_q\tnr{A}\rpa\lft{}{q}\,,\label{eq:funRepCompostaEsquerda}
\end{eqnarray}
onde $\tnr{AB}$ é o tensor resultante dos produtos contrativos em
cada caso. Nota-se que a manipulação de funções representantes compostas com
contração à direita é mais simples, já que não é necessário
inverter a se\-qüên\-cia dos tensores envolvidos\rodape{Esta é a
principal razão pela qual a maioria dos textos introdutórios optam
por funções representantes com contração à direita para substituir
o conceito de tensor.}.

Neste contexto, se for possível $n-1$ composições de uma mesma função representante $\tnr{A}_{\odot q}$, tem-se
\begin{equation}\label{eq:composicaoMultipla}
\tnr{A^n}_{\odot q}:=(\underbrace{\tnr{A}\odot_q\cdots\odot_q\tnr{A}}_{n\,\,\mathrm{vezes}})_{\odot q}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Função Representante Inversa}\index{função!representante!inversa}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, onde $2p\geqslant
s+q$, tal que $s$ e $q$ são positivos não nulos. Dado um tensor qualquer
$\tnr{A}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, uma função $\ftr{B}{q}$, onde
$\tnr{B}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, é dita inversa de $\ftr{A}{s}$ se
\begin{equation}
\ftr{A}{s}\circ\ftr{B}{q}=\ftr{I}{q}\,.
\end{equation}
Desta forma, com base nos conceitos de função representante
composta, tem-se o seguinte:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] Para contração à direita,
$\tnr{A}\odot_s\tnr{B}=\tnr{I}$;

\item[ii.] Para contração à esquerda,
$\tnr{B}\odot_s\tnr{A}=\tnr{I}$.
\end{itemize}

Pode-se realizar a tradicional representação da função inversa
$\ftr{B}{q}$ com $\lpa\ftr{A}{s}\rpa^{-1}$. No entanto, tal
notação só faz sentido se for explicitado o valor de $q$. Quando
$q=s$, utiliza-se a função
\begin{equation}\label{eq:representanteInversaSimples}
\fti{A}{q}:=\lpa\ftr{A}{q}\rpa^{-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Em termos de notação, tal definição não gera ambigüidade, já que
inexiste o conceito de ``tensor inverso''.

\subsubsection{Função Representante Transposta}\index{função!representante!transposta} Sejam os quatro espaços tensoriais
$\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, $\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$, $\ete{\crt{U}{s}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\ete{\crt{Z}{s}}{\con{F}}$, onde $s=p+q$. Dados os tensores quaisquer
$\tnr{X}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, $\tnr{Y}\in\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\tnr{A}\in\cft{\crt{U}{s}}{\con{F}}$, seja
\begin{equation}
\fua{\ftr{A}{p}}{\tnr{X}}\odot_q\tnr{Y}=\tnr{X}\odot_p\fua{\ftr{B}{q}}{\tnr{Y}}\,,
\end{equation}
onde $\tnr{B}\in\cft{\crt{Z}{s}}{\con{F}}$. A partir da
definição de função tensorial transposta, $\ftr{B}{q}$ é denominada função
representante transposta de $\ftr{A}{p}\,$. Nestas circunstâncias,
pode-se afirmar o seguinte:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] Para contração à direita,
$\crt{U}{s}=\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}$ e
$\crt{Z}{s}=\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}$;

\item[ii.] Para contração à esquerda,
$\crt{U}{s}=\crt{V}{p}\times\crt{W}{q}$ e
$\crt{Z}{s}=\crt{W}{q}\times\crt{V}{p}$.
\end{itemize}
Nota-se que a ordem dos produtos cartesianos $\crt{V}{p}$ e
$\crt{W}{q}$ que definem $\crt{U}{s}$ e $\crt{Z}{s}$ está sempre
invertida. Desta forma, se
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decompParaTransposta}
\tnr{A}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{qk}\otimes
\vto{v}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_{pk}\,,
\end{equation}
onde $\vto{w}_{ik}\in\con{W}_i$ e $\vto{v}_{ik}\in\con{V}_i$,
então obrigatoriamente
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decompTransposta}
\tnr{B}=\sum_{k=1}^m\vto{v}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{v}_{pk}\otimes
\vto{w}_{1k}\otimes\cdots\otimes\vto{w}_{qk}\,.
\end{equation}
Se nas igualdades anteriores $p=q$, segundo a definição (\ref{eq:transposicaoSucessiva}), o tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transpostaPermutacao}
\tnr{B}=\tnr{A}_{(1,1+p)(p,2p)}\,.
\end{equation}

Como ocorre no caso de função tensorial inversa, a representação
tradicional $(\ftr{A}{p})^T$ para a transposta de $\ftr{A}{p}$
deve vir acompanhada com o valor de $q$. Numa situação onde
$\crt{W}{q}=\crt{V}{p}$, não há este problema e pode-se ter uma
função
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transpostaTensor}
\ftt{A}{p}:=\lpa\ftr{A}{p}\rpa^T\,.
\end{equation}
Neste caso, vale salientar que as igualdades
(\ref{eq:decompParaTransposta}), (\ref{eq:decompTransposta}) e (\ref{eq:transpostaPermutacao})
permanecem inalteradas, exceto pelo fato de que agora
$\vto{w}_{ik}\in\con{V}_i$. Particularmente, se
$\vto{w}_{ik}=\vto{v}_{ik}$, a função tensorial $\ftr{A}{p}$ é
simétrica.

\subsubsection{Traço de Função Representante}\label{sec:tracoFuncaoRepresentante}\index{traço!de função representante}
Sejam os espaços tensoriais $\ete{\con{V}_{(p)}}{\con{F}}$  e
$\ete{\con{V}_{(p-2)}}{\con{F}}$ tais que $\con{V}_{(p)}=\crt{V}{p}$,
$\con{V}_r=\con{V}_s$ e
\begin{equation}
\con{V}_{(p-2)}:=\con{V}_1\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{r-1}\times\con{V}_{r+1}
\times\cdots\times\con{V}_{s-1}\times\con{V}_{s+1}\times\cdots\times\con{V}_p\,.
\end{equation}
Nestas condições, utilizando (\ref{eq:tracoTensor}), diz-se que a função
\begin{equation}
\fua{\trt{r}{s}}{\ftr{T}{q_1}}:=\lpa\fua{\trt{r}{s}}{\tnr{T}}\rpa_{\odot_{q_2}}\,,
\end{equation}
onde $q_1\leqslant p$ e $q_2\leqslant p-2$, é denominada traço da função representante $\ftr{T}{q_1}$ em $r,s$.
Com base nesta definição, considerando o caso particular de tensores de segunda ordem, cujo espaço tensorial é definido por $\con{V}_{(2)}=\con{V}^{2}$, tem-se que o traço $\fua{\trt{1}{2}}{\ftr{T}{q_1}}$, onde $q_1\leqslant 2$, resulta uma função escalar, pois
\begin{equation}
 \fua{\trt{1}{2}}{\tnr{T}}\in\con{F}.
\end{equation}
Ainda neste contexto, se $\con{V}$ definir um espaço vetorial de Hilbert com dimensão $n$, seja $\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}{2}}$ base de $\ete{\con{V}^2}{\con{F}}$, gerada pelos tensores poliádicos $\vto{u}_{i_1}\otimes\vto{u}^*_{i_2}$, $i_j=1,\cdots,n\,$. Dado um tensor qualquer $\tnr{A}\in\cft{\con{V}^{2}}{\con{F}}$, pode-se realizar o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray}
\fua{\trt{1}{2}}{\ftr{A}{q_1}}&:=&\fua{\trt{1}{2}}{\sum_{i_1=1}^{n}\sum_{i_2=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1
i_2}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{2}}}}{\tnr{A}}\vto{u}_{i_1}\otimes\vto{u}^*_{i_2}}\nonumber\\
&:=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n}\sum_{i_2=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1
i_2}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{2}}}}{\tnr{A}}\fua{\trt{1}{2}}{\vto{u}_{i_1}\otimes\vto{u}^*_{i_2}}\nonumber\\
&:=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n}\sum_{i_2=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1
i_2}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{2}}}}{\tnr{A}}\delta_{i_1i_2}\nonumber\\
&:=&\sum_{i_1=1}^{n}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1
i_1}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{2}}}}{\tnr{A}}\nonumber\\
&:=&\trc{\lco\tnr{A}\rco^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{2}}}}\,.
\end{eqnarray}




\subsection{Hiperdeterminante de Operador Tensorial Linear}\index{hiperdeterminante!de operador tensorial linear}\label{sec:HiperdeterminanteOperador}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, gerado por espaços de Hilbert
$m$-dimensionais, e o espaço vetorial de funções tensoriais lineares
$\evl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\con{F}}$. Dado o operador
tensorial $\psi\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, sejam os
tensores anti-simétricos não nulos $\tnr{P}^\psi,\tnr{P}\in\cfa{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$ e o
inteiro $q=p.n$, tais que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:determinanteUm}
\fua{\tnr{P}^\psi_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n} :=
\fua{\tnr{P}_{\odot_q}}{
{\fua{\psi}{\tnr{X}_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi}{\tnr{X}_n}}}\,,\,\forall\,
\tnr{X}_i\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}\,.
\end{equation}
Com base na proposição \ref{teo:dimensaoEspacoAlternante}, seja $\{\tnr{P}\}$ uma base
do subespaço $\etn{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$ de $\ete{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$, tal que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:determinanteDois}
\tnr{P}^\psi = \alpha\tnr{P}\,,
\end{equation}
onde $\alpha\in\con{F}$. Nestas condições, diz-se que o escalar $\alpha$ é o
hiperdeterminante do operador tensorial linear $\psi$, representado $\hpd{\psi}$. Para
que tal definição seja plausível, deve ser mostrado que o valor do escalar $\alpha$ em
(\ref{eq:determinanteDois}) é o mesmo para qualquer tensor do conjunto
$\cfa{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$. Para tal, dado um outro tensor qualquer $\beta\tnr{P}$ deste
conjunto, considerando (\ref{eq:determinanteUm}) e (\ref{eq:determinanteDois}), pode-se
dizer que
\begin{equation}
\lpa\beta\tnr{P}\rpa^\psi = \beta\tnr{P}^\psi =
\beta\alpha\tnr{P}=\alpha\lpa\beta\tnr{P}\rpa\,,\,\forall\,\beta\in\con{F}\,;
\end{equation}
de onde se conclui que $\alpha$ depende somente de $\psi$. Nos termos do Teorema \ref{teo:RieszGeneralizado}, como a função $\psi$ pode ser representante de um tensor $\tnr{S}\in\cft{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{\con{F}}$, então o escalar
\begin{equation}
\hpd{\tnr{S}}:=\hpd{\psi}
\end{equation}
é dito o \emph{hiperdeterminante do tensor} $\tnr{S}$.\index{hiperdeterminante!de tensor}

Com base na definição (\ref{eq:determinanteUm}), é possível escrever que
\begin{equation}\label{eq:determinanteTensor}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{
{\fua{\psi}{\tnr{X}_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi}{\tnr{X}_n}}}=(\hpd{\psi})\,\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n}\,,
\end{equation}
para quaisquer $\tnr{X}_i\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e
$\tnr{T}\in\cfa{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}\,$. A partir desta igualdade, dados os operadores
lineares $\psi_1,\psi_2\in\cfl{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$,
utilizando duas bases quaisquer $\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ e
$\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ de $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, tem-se as
seguintes propriedades:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] $\hpd{\psi_1\circ\psi_2}=\hpd{\psi_1}\hpd{\psi_2}$\,;
\item[ii.] $\hpd{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}=1$;
\item[iii.] $\psi_1$ automórfico $\implies \hpd{\psi_1^{-1}} = \lpa\hpd{\psi_1}\rpa^{-1}$\,;
\item[iv.] $\psi_1$ automórfico $\Longleftrightarrow\hpd{\psi_1}\neq 0$;
\item[v.]
$\hpd{\psi_1}=
\hpd{\lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}\rco^{\tilde{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}\,$;
\item[vi.] $\ete{\crt{V}{q}}{\con{F}}$ Euclidiano $\implies\hpd{\psi_1^T} =\hpd{\psi_1}\,$;
\item[vii.] $\psi_1$ ortogonal e $\ete{\crt{V}{q}}{\con{F}}$ Euclidiano $\implies\hpd{\psi_1}=\pm1\,$.
\end{itemize}
Considerando o último ítem, caso seu hiperdeterminante seja positivo,
$\psi_1$ é chamado operador ortogonal \emph{próprio}\index{operador!tensorial!ortogonal próprio}, senão, ele
é \emph{impróprio}\index{operador!tensorial!ortogonal impróprio}.

\noindent\begin{prova}
Vamos demonstrar as propriedades citadas com os itens respectivos apresentados a seguir.
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.] Seja o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\hpd{\psi_1\circ\psi_2})\,\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n}
&=&\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{
{\fua{\psi_1\circ\psi_2}{\tnr{X}_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi_1\circ\psi_2}{\tnr{X}_n}}}\noindent\\
&=&(\hpd{\psi_1})\,\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{
{\fua{\psi_2}{\tnr{X}_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi_2}{\tnr{X}_n}}}\noindent\\
&=&(\hpd{\psi_1})(\hpd{\psi_2})\,\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{
{\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n}}\noindent
\end{eqnarray*}
\item[ii.]  De (\ref{eq:determinanteTensor}), a obtenção da igualdade deste ítem é imediata.

\item[iii.]  Utilizando o resultado dos dois itens anteriores, tem-se que
\begin{equation*}
(\hpd{\psi_1})(\hpd{\psi_1^{-1}}) = \hpd{\psi_1\circ\psi_1^{-1}}  = \hpd{\vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}}}= 1\,.
\end{equation*}
\item[iv.] A constatação de que $\psi_1$ bijeção $\Rightarrow\hpd{\psi_1}\neq 0$ é conseqüência imediata da demonstração do item iii. Agora vejamos se $\hpd{\psi_1}\neq 0\Rightarrow\psi_1$ bijeção.
Vamos mostrar primeiramente que, dado um tensor qualquer
$\tnr{T}\in\cfa{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$ e um tensor
$\tnr{X}:=\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_\alpha\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_\beta\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n$,
onde $\tnr{X}_\alpha=\tnr{X}_\beta$,
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}}=0\,.
\end{equation*}
Para tal, sabemos que $\tnr{T}=-\tnr{T}_{(\alpha,\beta)}$ e $\tnr{X}_{(\alpha,\beta)}=\tnr{X}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_\beta\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_\alpha\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{X}_n$. Desta forma,
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}}=-\fua{{\tnr{T}_{(\alpha,\beta)}}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}}=-\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}_{(\alpha,\beta)}}\,.
\end{equation*}
Mas como $\tnr{X}_\alpha=\tnr{X}_\beta$, então
$\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}}=-\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{X}}$, c.q.d. Com base
neste resultado, vamos demonstrar agora que se o conjunto
$\con{Y}=\{\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Y}_n\}$ for linearmente dependente, então
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{Y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_n}=0\,.
\end{equation*}
Para tal, vamos dizer que um tensor $\tnr{Y}_\alpha$ de $\con{Y}$ é combinação linear dos demais elementos do conjunto. Pode-se realizar então o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{Y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_\alpha\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_n}&=&\nonumber\\
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{Y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\sum_{i=1}^n\gamma_i(1-\delta_{i\alpha})\tnr{Y}_i\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_n}&=&\nonumber\\
\sum_{i=1}^n\gamma_i(1-\delta_{i\alpha})\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\tnr{Y}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_i\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Y}_n}&=&0\nonumber\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
A última igualdade ocorre porque para cada valor do índice $i\neq\alpha$, o produto
tensorial, argumento de $\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}$, sempre possui dois tensores iguais, c.q.d.
Tomando este resultado e (\ref{eq:determinanteTensor}), se $\hpd{\psi_1}\neq 0$, então
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{
{\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{Z}_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{Z}_n}}}\neq 0
\end{equation*}
e
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{ {\tnr{Z}_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{Z}_n}}\neq 0\,.
\end{equation*}
Como conseqüência os conjuntos $\{\tnr{Z}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Z}_n\}$ e
$\{\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{Z}_1},\cdots,\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{Z}_n}\}$ são linearmente
independentes. Desta conclusão, como $\tnr{Z}_i$ são tensores quaisquer, dada uma base de
tensores poliádicos $\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ de $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
construída a partir de $\con{U}_i=\{{\vto{v}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots, {\vto{v}_{m}}^{(i)}\}$,
onde $n_i$ é a dimensão de $\ehr{V_i}{F}$, pode-se afirmar que o conjunto
\begin{equation*}
\lch\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{j_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{j_p}}^{(p)}},\cdots\rch\,,
j_i= 1,\cdots,m
\end{equation*}
é linearmente independente. Desta forma, considerando dois tensores distintos quaisquer
$\tnr{K}_1,\tnr{K}_2\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, pode-se dizer então que os valores
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{K}_1}=\sum_{i_1=1}^{m}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\tnr{K}_1}\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{i_1}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}\,
\end{equation*}
e
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\psi_1}{\tnr{K}_2}=\sum_{i_1=1}^{m}\cdots\sum_{i_p=1}^{m}\fua{\vtf{f}_{i_1\cdots
i_p}^{\con{T}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}}}{\tnr{K}_2}\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{i_1}}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{i_p}}^{(p)}}\,
\end{equation*}
também são distintos. Se é assim, então o operador $\psi_1$ é uma injeção. Nos termos da
proposição \ref{teo:operadorBijecao}, $\psi_1$ é também uma bijeção.
\item[v.] Dada uma base qualquer de
tensores poliádicos $\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\crt{V}{p}}$ de $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$,
construída a partir de $\con{U}_i=\{{\vto{v}_1}^{(i)} ,\cdots, {\vto{v}_{m}}^{(i)}\}$ e
um tensor anti-simétrico  qualquer $\tnr{T}\in\cfa{(\crt{V}{p})^n}{F}$, onde $n=m^p$.
Dado $i_j=1,\cdots,m$ e sabendo que
\begin{eqnarray*}
\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{(i_1)_l}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_l}}^{(p)}}=\sum_{(j_1)_l=1}^{m}\cdots\sum_{(j_p)_l=1}^{m}\lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco_{(i_1)_l\cdots(i_p)_1(j_1)_l\cdots(j_p)_l}^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}&&\\
{\vto{v}_{(j_1)_l}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(j_p)_l}}^{(p)}\,,
\end{eqnarray*}
pode-se realizar o seguinte desenvolvimento:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{(i_1)_1}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_1}}^{(p)}}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi_1}{{\vto{v}_{(i_1)_n}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_n}}^{(p)}}}&=&\\
\sum_{(j_1)_1=1}^{m}\cdots\sum_{(j_p)_1=1}^{m}
\lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco_{(i_1)_1\cdots(i_p)_1(j_1)_1\cdots(j_p)_1}^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\cdots

Por meio de (\ref{eq:somaLeviCivita}), (\ref{eq:tensorAlternante}) e
(\ref{eq:transposicaoTensor}), podemos continuar assim:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{n!}\lco\sum_{(k_1)_1=1}^{m}\cdots\sum_{(k_p)_1=1}^{m}
\lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco_{(i_1)_1\cdots(i_p)_1(k_1)_1\cdots(k_p)_1}^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\cdots

\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_n}}^{(p)}}&&
\end{eqnarray*}
porque o último termo foi colocado em evidência já que o tensor $\tnr{T}$ é anti-simétrico. É importante observar que este resultado fica inalterado se fossem adotadas duas bases diferentes de tensores poliádicos. Comparando esta igualdade com (\ref{eq:hiperdeterminante}) e com (\ref{eq:determinanteTensor}), conclui-se  a igualdade do ítem.
\item[vi.] A última igualdade da demonstração do ítem anterior, escrita para $\psi_1^T$, pode ser apresentada na forma:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\fua{\tnr{T}_{\odot_q}}{\fua{\psi_1^T}{{\vto{v}_{(i_1)_1}}^{(1)}\otimes
\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_1}}^{(p)}}\otimes\cdots\otimes\fua{\psi_1^T}{{\vto{v}_{(i_1)_n}}^{(1)}\otimes

\cdots\otimes{\vto{v}_{(i_p)_n}}^{(p)}}\,.&&
\end{eqnarray*}
Combinando (\ref{eq:arrayfunTensorialTransposta}) com o fato de que
\begin{equation*}
{\lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}}^T_{(i_1)_l\cdots(i_p)_l(k_1)_l\cdots(k_p)_l}= \lco{\psi_1}_{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\rco_{(k_1)_l\cdots(k_p)_l(i_1)_l\cdots(i_p)_l}^{\hat{\con{T}}^{\otimes}_{\con{V}^{p}}}\,,
\end{equation*}
tem-se que o termo destacado na primeira igualdade é igual ao da última igualdade do ítem anterior. Isto ocorre porque os fatores da soma global, promovida pelo diversos somatórios envolvidos, sofrem apenas alteração de posição.
\item[vii.] Se $\psi_1^T=\psi_1^{-1}$ então
\begin{equation*}
\hpd{\psi_1}\hpd{\psi_1^{-1}}=\hpd{\psi_1}\hpd{\psi_1^{T}}=\lpa\hpd{\psi_1}\rpa^2=1\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\section{Isotropia e Anti-Isotropia}\index{isotropia}
O conceito de isotropia possui estreita relação com o de
invariância. A grosso modo, diz-se que uma quantidade ou medida é
isotrópica se seu valor independe do efeito de qualquer função
ortogonal que eventualmente aja no seu domínio de atuação. Se esta
independência se restringir somente a funções ortogonais próprias,
a medida é anti-isotrópica\index{anti-isotropia}. Medidas que não
apresentam nenhuma destas características são chamadas
\emph{anisotrópicas}\index{anisotróprica!medida}.

Considerando um espaço vetorial Euclidiano, medidas isotrópicas,
representadas por grandezas de segunda ordem (matrizes), por
exemplo, são \emph{indiferentes} a rotações e reflexões. Ocorrendo
reflexões, medidas an\-ti-iso\-tró\-pi\-cas podem sofrer
alteração.

\subsection{Tensores Invariantes}\index{tensor!invariante}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e o grupo de
operadores tensoriais $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{}$.
Considerando que o conjunto
$\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq
\con{P}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ define o grupo de operadores
$\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\backsim}$, um tensor
$\tnr{T}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é invariante à atuação do
grupo $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\backsim}$ se
\begin{equation}
\fua{\psi}{\tnr{T}}=\tnr{T}\,,\,\forall\,\psi\in\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,.
\end{equation}
Caso a igualdade anterior seja válida para qualquer tensor
$\tnr{T}$ de $\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, diz-se que o espaço
tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é invariante ao grupo
$\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\backsim}$. Como exemplo, pode-se
observar que $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é invariante ao grupo
definido pelo conjunto $\{ \vtf{i}_{\crt{V}{p}} \}$.

\subsubsection{Tensor Isotrópico}\index{tensor!isotrópico} Um tensor é dito isotrópico se
ele for invariante ao grupo ortogonal como um todo. Em outras
palavras, se o grupo de operadores tensoriais considerado for
$\gro{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, um tensor
$\tnr{T}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é isotrópico se
\begin{equation}
\fua{\psi}{\tnr{T}}=\tnr{T}\,,\,\forall\,\psi\in\con{O}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Tensor Anti-Isotrópico}\index{tensor!anti-isotrópico} Um tensor é anti-isotrópico
se ele for invariante ao grupo ortogonal próprio. Desta forma, com
base no conjunto $\con{O}^+_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ formado
por operadores ortogonais próprios, para um tensor anti-isotrópico
$\tnr{T}\in\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ ,
\begin{equation}
\fua{\psi}{\tnr{T}}=\tnr{T}\,,\,\forall\,\psi\in\con{O}^+_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,,
\end{equation}
onde o conjunto considerado define o grupo ortogonal
$\grr{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$. Com isso, conclui-se que um
tensor isotrópico é sempre anti-isotrópico.

\subsection{Conjuntos de Tensores Invariantes}\index{conjunto!de tensores invariantes}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e o grupo de
operadores tensoriais $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{}$.
Considerando o grupo $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\backsim}$
definido por $\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq
\con{P}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, diz-se que
$\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}\subseteq \cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é
conjunto de tensores invariantes ao grupo considerado se
\begin{equation}
\fua{\psi}{\tnr{T}}=\tnr{T}\,,\,\forall\,\psi\in\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,,\,
\tnr{T}\in\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}\,.
\end{equation}
Se $\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}=
\con{O}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, então o conjunto
$\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ é formado por tensores isotrópicos,
sendo representado por $\cts{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$. Para
$\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}=
\con{O}^+_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$, o conjunto de tensores
anti-isotrópicos é representado $\ctt{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$.

\subsubsection{Exemplos de Tensores Isotrópicos e
Anti-Isotrópicos} Seja o espaço vetorial $\ehr{V}{\con{F}}$, o
espaço tensorial $\ete{\con{V}^p}{\con{F}}$ , o tensor identidade
$\tnr{I}\in\cft{\con{V}^2}{\con{F}}$ e o tensor anti-simétrico não
nulo $\tnr{A}\in\cfa{\con{V}^2}{\con{F}}$. Nestas condições
particulares, \aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1}, citando
\aut{Weyl}\cite{weyl_1997_1}, afirma que os conjuntos de tensores
isotrópicos não vazios são gerados (span) pela permutação de
tensores identidade. Segundo ele, conjuntos de tensores
anti-isotrópicos não vazios são gerados pela permutação de
tensores identidade e$\backslash$ou de tensores anti-simétricos
não nulos e$\backslash$ou dos tensores $\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{A}$,
$\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{A}$,
$\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{I}\otimes\tnr{A}$, etc\ldots Em
termos específicos, para espaços tensoriais de ordem 0 a 4,
\aut{Backus}\cite{backus_1997_1} demonstra cada um dos resultados
apresentados na tabela \ref{tb:Isotropicos} a seguir.

\subsection{Operadores Tensoriais de Invariância}\index{operador!tensorial!de invariância}
Seja o espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ e o grupo de
operadores tensoriais $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{}$. Seja o
conjunto de tensores $\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, invariantes ao
grupo $\gqq{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\backsim}$ definido por
$\con{\tilde{P}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq
\con{P}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$. Um operador tensorial
$\psi\in\con{P}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ é dito de invariância
em $\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ se ele definir o mapeamento
\begin{equation}
\map{\psi}{\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}{\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\,.
\end{equation}
O conjunto
$\con{I}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq\con{P}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$
de todos os operadores de invariância que atuam em
$\cti{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$ define o grupo de invariância
$\grn{}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$.

\subsubsection{Operadores Tensoriais de Isotropia}\index{operador!tensorial!de isotropia}
Dadas as condições anteriores, o operador tensorial de isotropia é
um operador de invariância em $\cts{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$. Com
isso, tem-se o grupo de isotropia
$\gso{}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$ definido pelo conjunto
$\con{\hat{I}}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq\con{I}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$
.

\subsubsection{Operadores Tensoriais de Anti-Isotropia}\index{operador!tensorial!de anti-isotropia}
Neste caso, são operadores de invariância em
$\ctt{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}$, elementos do conjunto
$\con{\hat{I}}^+_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}\subseteq\con{I}_{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$
que define o grupo $\gsm{}{\cft{\crt{V}{p}}{\con{F}}}$.


\section{Campo Tensorial}\index{campo!tensorial}
Seja o espaço métrico completo $\lpa \con{A}, \varrho \rpa$ e o
espaço tensorial $\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$. Dado o subconjunto
$\con{B}\subset\con{A}$, que também define um espaço métrico
completo, a função no mapeamento
\begin{equation}
\map{\fac{F}}{B}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}
\end{equation}
é dita um campo tensorial. Caso $q=1$, tem-se então um \emph{campo
vetorial}\index{campo!tensorial}. Se $q=0$, o campo é dito
\emph{escalar}.\index{campo!escalar}

\subsection{A Relação Campo
Tensorial e Função Tensorial}\label{sec:AfimTensorial} Seja
$\saf{U}{S}{\ele{a}}{F}$ um subespaço afim do espaço métrico
completo $\eaf{V}{A}{F}$ e um sistema de coordenadas $(\ele{o} ,
\tilde{\con{U}})$ deste subespaço. Considerando o espaço tensorial
$\ete{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}$ e o espaço vetorial $\evt{U}{F}$ (ou
$\ete{\con{U}}{\con{F}}$), dado um mapeamento
\begin{equation}
\map{\fac{F}}{\epo{S}_\ele{a}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}},
\end{equation}
e a igualdade $\ele{a}=\vto{a}\oplus\ele{o}$, existe uma única uma
função tensorial que define
\begin{equation}
\map{\psi}{\con{U}}{\cft{\crt{W}{q}}{\con{F}}}\,,
\end{equation}
cuja regra é
\begin{equation}\label{eq:funcaoCampo}
\fua{\psi}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\fac{F}}{\vto{x}\oplus\vto{a}\oplus\ele{o}}\,.
\end{equation}
Como o domínio
$\epo{S}_\ele{a}=\{\vto{x}\oplus\vto{a}\oplus\ele{o}:\vto{x}\in\con{U}\}$,
onde $\vto{a}\oplus\ele{o}$ é um ponto fixo, pode-se dizer que
$\psi$ é a função tensorial associada ao campo tensorial
$\fac{F}$. Desta forma, o estudo de campos tensoriais pode ser substituído pelo
estudo de funções tensoriais.

\subsubsection{Campo Característico}\index{campo!característico}
Seja um espaço afim métrico completo $\eaf{V}{A}{F}$ com
dimensão maior que 2 e dois de seus subespaços
$\saf{U}{S}{\ele{a}}{F}$ e $\saf{W}{S}{\ele{b}}{F}$, tais que
$\epo{S}_\ele{b}\subset\epo{S}_\ele{a}$. Dado um sistema de
coordenadas $(\ele{o} , \tilde{\con{U}})$ de
$\saf{U}{S}{\ele{a}}{F}$ pelo qual o ponto
$\ele{b}=\vto{b}\oplus\ele{o}$, seja o mapeamento bijetor
\begin{equation}
\map{\fac{F}}{\epo{S}_\ele{b}}{\con{W}}\,,
\end{equation}
onde a função identidade $\fun{i}_\con{W}$ está associada ao campo
$\fac{F}$. Logo,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:campoDescritor}
\fua{\fac{F}}{\vto{w}\oplus\vto{b}\oplus\ele{o}}=\vto{w}\,,\,\forall\,
\vto{w}\in\con{W}\,.
\end{equation}
Nestas condições, diz-se que $\fac{F}$ é um campo característico de $\epo{S}_\ele{b}$
em $\con{W}$, representado $\fac{F}_{\epo{S}_\ele{b}}^{\con{W}}$.

%Considerando um
%mapeamento sobrejetor
%\begin{equation}
%\map{\chi}{\con{U}}{\con{W}}\,,
%\end{equation}
%pode-se reescrever (\ref{eq:campoDescritor}) na forma
%\begin{equation}
%\fua{\mathcal{F}}{\fua{\chi}{\vto{x}}\oplus\vto{b}\oplus\ele{o}}=\fua{\chi}{\vto{x}}\,.
%\end{equation}
%A partir desta igualdade, a função $\chi$ é dita característica de
%$\epo{S}_\ele{b}$ em $\con{U}$, representada
%$\fac{F}_{\epo{S}_\ele{b}}^{\con{U}}$. É importante notar que funções características permitem substituir o uso de pontos pelo de vetores, viabilizando manipulações algébricas.
