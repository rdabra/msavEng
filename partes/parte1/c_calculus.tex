Analysis is the branch of Mathematics that studies the behaviour of functions by using the idea of limit, considered fundamental, and its subordinate concepts. When such concepts involve  differentiation and integration, as well as their related definitions, Analysis is commonly known as Calculus. Intuitively speaking, up to this point, we have dealt with functions in a kind of ``static'' approach: on previous chapters, the sole definition of a mapping, with its associated function explicitly described or not, was sufficient for developing the concepts presented. Now, we are also interested in a ``dynamic'' approach for functions, where it is important not only to specify them but also to describe how their values evolve on their images, or how they behave, through derivatives and integrals. In this context, considering the study of tensors started on chapter \ref{cp:tensor}, the following pages introduce the Calculus of tensor functions, usually called Tensor Calculus. Since a tensor function is the most general type of function presented so far, we do not deviate from our main objective of being as abstract as possible on behalf of mathematical beauty.



\section{Differentiation}\label{sec:diffe}

In the context of Banach tensor spaces, which are normed and complete, to differentiate a tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ is to obtain its derivative, here understood as a linear tensor function that measures qualitatively and quantitatively \textsb{local sensitivity}\index{function!sensitivity}\index{sensitivity}, that is, the sensitivity of $\tnr{\psi}$ on an element of the domain. Intuitively speaking, sensitivity refers to the intrinsic ``susceptibility'' of a function, or how it would ``react'', by varying its values, to an \emph{eventual small change} on its argument. In the specific case of derivatives, this function ``reaction'' is \emph{linearly estimated} on an element of its domain. However, not all tensor functions can be differentiable: the following mathematical conditions and definitions will describe which functions admit differentiation. Considering $\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}$ and $\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}$ Banach tensor spaces, \emph{both defined by the same field} $\cam{F}$, let $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subset\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}$ be an open set and element  $\tnr{X}_0\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ an arbitrary tensor at which local sensitivity is measured. The functions in $\map{\tnr{\psi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ and $\map{\tnr{\kappa}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ are said to be \textsb{tangent}\index{function!tangent} to each other at $\tnr{X}_0$ if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tangent}
\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\kappa}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}}{\|\tnr{X}\|}=\tnr{0}\,,
\end{equation}
In other words, as variable $\tnr{X}$ tends to the zero tensor, the numerator tends to the zero tensor faster than $\|\tnr{X}\|$ tends to zero and then, on the limit, equality $\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}=\fua{\tnr{\kappa}}{\tnr{X}_0}$ must hold. From this definition, it is possible to obtain that if two functions are tangent to $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$, they are tangent to each other at this tensor.

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Since the sum of limits is the limit of sums, the previous statement can be verified by considering functions $\tnr{\kappa}_1$ and $\tnr{\kappa}_2$ tangent to $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ and subtracting both limit expressions described by \eqref{eq:tangent} :
\begin{align*}
\tnr{0}&=\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\kappa}_1}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}+\fua{\tnr{\kappa}_2}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}}{\|\tnr{X}\|}\\
&=\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\kappa}_2}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\kappa}_1}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}}{\|\tnr{X}\|}\,.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}}

Proceeding with the above conditions, if there is one and only one tensor function \gloref{tangent}, tangent to $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$, described by the rule
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tangentFunct}
\fua{\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}-\tnr{X}_0}\,,
\end{equation}
where function $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}\in\evl{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ is bounded, then $\tnr{\psi}$ is called \textsb{Fr\'echet differentiable}\index{function!Fr\'echet differentiable}, \textsb{totally differentiable}\index{function!totally differentiable} or simply \textsb{differentiable}\index{function!differentiable} at $\tnr{X}_0$, while the linear function $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}$ is called the \textsb{derivative}\index{derivative} of $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$, whose value at $\tnr{X}_0$ is described by tensor 
\begin{equation}
\gloref{derivativeAt}:=[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}](\tnr{X}_0)\,, 
\end{equation}
from which we conclude that tensor function $D\tnr{\psi}\in\evl{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ . According to \eqref{eq:funcaoLimitada}, linearity and boundedness imply continuity, and then $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}$ belongs to function space $\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$, which we specify to be also a Banach space of continuous linear functions. Moreover, the function in
$\map{\gloref{derivative}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}$ is said to be the \textsb{derivative function}\index{derivative!function} or simply the derivative of $\tnr{\psi}$. 
Rewriting expression \eqref{eq:tangent} for $\tnr{\psi}$ and $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}$ tangent at $\tnr{X}_0$, the result is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:preDirect}
\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}-\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}}{\|\tnr{X}\|}=\tnr{0}\,,
\end{equation}
from which we can conclude that the numerator tends to the zero tensor faster than the denominator tends to zero, otherwise there would be no definite limit. If numerator tends to the zero tensor, the term $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}$ results an approximation for the difference $\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}$, and that is why the derivative is said to be a local linear approximation of a function and $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}$ is called the \textsb{differential}\index{differential} of $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$. Moreover, since the previous equality is valid for $\tnr{X}$ tending to the zero tensor through an arbitrary ``path'', let's choose a specific direction by considering an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{H}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ in such a way that $\tnr{X}=\alpha\tnr{H}$, where $\alpha\in\real$ is the variable, and then
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}-\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\alpha\tnr{H}}}{|\alpha|}=\tnr{0}\,.
\end{equation*}
Multiplying both sides by $\sgn{\alpha}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}}{\alpha}-\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{H}}}{\alpha}=\sgn{\alpha}\tnr{0}\,,
\end{equation*}
which results
\begin{equation}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{H}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}}{\alpha}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{H}}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}$ is called the \textsb{directional derivative}\index{derivative!directional} of $\tnr{\psi}$ along $\tnr{H}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$. From this definition, when there is a directional derivative of $\tnr{\psi}$ for any $\tnr{X}_0\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, the function described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:directDeriv}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}}{\alpha}
\end{equation}
is said to be the directional derivative\footnote{It is important to say a few words about a less restricted or weaker type of derivative than the Fr\'echet derivative just presented. It is not defined from the concept of tangency but from a directional derivative in which the derivative involved is not necessarily bounded and linear. Considering the above conditions, the tensor function in $\map{\tnr{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ is said to be \textsb{G\^ateaux differentiable}\index{function!G\^ateaux differentiable} at $\tnr{X}_0$ if there exists a mapping $\map{\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'_G}{\tnr{X}_0}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$, not necessarily bounded and linear, where
\begin{equation*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'_G}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_0+\alpha\tnr{X}}-\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_0}}{\alpha}\,.
\end{equation*}
The tensor $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'_G}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}$ is called the \textsb{G\^ateaux differential}\index{differential!G\^ateaux} of $\tnr{\varphi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ and $\tnr{\varphi}'_G$ is the \textsb{G\^ateaux derivative}\index{derivative!G\^ateaux} of $\tnr{\varphi}$. Every Fr\'echet differentiable function is also G\^ateaux differentiable, but the converse is obviously not true. What is less obvious is the following: even when G\^ateaux derivative $\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'_G}{\tnr{X}_0}$ is bounded and linear, G\^ateaux differentiability, which means differentiability along all directions at a point, does not assure Fr\'echet differentiability. This present study will require only the stronger restrictions from the Fr\'echet differentiation. For further developments of the G\^ateaux derivative, see \aut{Wouk}\cite{wouk_1979_1}, chapter 12.} of $\tnr{\psi}$ along $\tnr{H}$. 

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
The above theory would be useless if there were no tangent function $\tnr{\delta_\mathit{d}}$ for any given function $\tnr{\delta}$. Considering the rules $\fua{\tnr{\delta}}{\tnr{X}}=\alpha\tnr{X}$ and $\fua{\tnr{\delta_\mathit{d}}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\delta}}{\tnr{X}_0}+\alpha(\tnr{X}-\tnr{X}_0)=\alpha\tnr{X}$, function $\tnr{\delta_\mathit{d}}$ tangent to $\tnr{\delta}$ on $\tnr{X}_0$ can be easily verified from \eqref{eq:preDirect}. Now, let's prove that there is only one function $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}$ tangent to $\tnr{\psi}$ by supposing functions $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d1}}$ and $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d2}}$ tangent to $\tnr{\psi}$. One equality \eqref{eq:preDirect} can be obtained for each tangent function and subtracting these equalities results
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}-\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}}}{\|\tnr{X}\|}=\lim_{\tnr{X}\to \tnr{0}} \dfrac{\{[\tnr{\psi}'_2-\tnr{\psi}'_1](\tnr{X}_0)\}(\tnr{X})}{\|\tnr{X}\|}=\tnr{0}\,.
\end{equation*}
Since these equalities are valid for any $\tnr{X}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, let's admit $\tnr{X}=\alpha\tnr{H}$, where $\tnr{H}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ is a non zero given tensor and $\alpha$ is a positive real number. Thereby, previous equalities lead to
\begin{equation*}
	\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\{[\tnr{\psi}'_2-\tnr{\psi}'_1](\tnr{X}_0)\}(\alpha\tnr{H})}{\|\alpha\tnr{H}\|}=\dfrac{\{[\tnr{\psi}'_2-\tnr{\psi}'_1](\tnr{X}_0)\}(\tnr{H})}{\|\tnr{H}\|}=\tnr{0}\,
\end{equation*}
which are valid for any chosen $\tnr{X}_0$ and then $\tnr{\psi}'_2=\tnr{\psi}'_1$.
\end{proof}}

From previous conditions, it is possible to obtain the following important properties for derivatives by considering the function in mapping $\map{\tnr{\psi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ differentiable in its domain, an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{H}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ and a scalar $\beta\in\cam{F}$.

	\begin{equation}
	\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\cdot\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} + \fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} \cdot \fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\,;

\begin{equation}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\otimes\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} + \fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} \otimes \fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\,;
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Verification of items i and ii are straightforward results after specifying their respective rules of $\tnr{\psi}$ on definition \eqref{eq:directDeriv}. For the case of item iii, the use of \eqref{eq:directDeriv} leads to
\begin{equation*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} = \fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} + \fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} = \fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\fua{[\fua{[\tnr{\psi}'_1+\tnr{\psi}'_2]}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}\,.
\end{equation*}
Now, in order to prove the chain rule, we adapt the strategy of \aut{Zeidler}\cite{zeidler_1995_1}, p. 248, as follows. Considering the concept of derivative as an approximation, from \eqref{eq:directDeriv} it is correct to say that there is a residue $\fua{r_1}{\beta\tnr{Z}}$ that tends to the zero tensor when non-zero $\beta\in\cam{F}$ tends to zero, where
\begin{equation*}
\beta\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1}{\tnr{Y}}]}{\tnr{Z}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{Y}+\beta\tnr{Z}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{Y}}+\fua{r_1}{\beta\tnr{Z}}
\end{equation*}
and $\tnr{Y},\tnr{Z}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}$ are arbitrary. For the case of $\tnr{\psi}_2$, we write
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}+\fua{r_2}{\alpha\tnr{H}}.
\end{equation*}
Specifying $\tnr{Y}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$ and $\tnr{Z}=\alpha/\beta\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}$ on the first equality, then
\begin{align*}
	\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}}&=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{Y}}+\fua{r_1}{\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}}\\
	\alpha[[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]\circ\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}](\tnr{H})&=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}+\fua{r_2}{\alpha\tnr{H}}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{r_1}{\alpha\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}}
\end{align*}
Dividing both sides by $\alpha$ and taking them to the limit of $\alpha$ tending to zero, item iv is verified. The product rule is proved by the following development: adding and subtracting the right hand side of
\begin{equation*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}\odot_q\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\odot_q\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]
\end{equation*}
by $\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}\odot_{q}\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$, we arrive at
\begin{align*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}&=\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha\{ \fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}\odot_{q}[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}] +\\
& \qquad\qquad\qquad+[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}]\odot_q\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\}\\
&= \fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\odot_{q}\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}] +\\
& \qquad\qquad\qquad+\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}]\odot_q\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\,.
\end{align*}
Since item vi is a corollary of the product rule, its verification is trivial. Item vii is verified by a similar procedure we used for the product rule. 
\end{proof}}

Considering a mapping $\map{\tnr{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_1\times\cdots\times\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_q}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$, where $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_i\subset\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}$ is open and the values of $\tnr{\varphi}$ are represented by the multivariate notation $\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}$, if there is a tangent function $\tnr{\varphi_\mathit{d}}$ to $\tnr{\varphi}$ at $(\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Y}_q)\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_1\times\cdots\times\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_q$ where
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\varphi_\mathit{d}}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}=\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Y}_q}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Y}_q}]}{\tnr{X}_1-\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q-\tnr{Y}_q}
\end{equation*}
and $\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{Y}_1,\cdots,\tnr{Y}_q}$ is multilinear, then $\tnr{\varphi}$ is said to be totally differentiable and, by a similar development to the case of univariate tensor functions, we arrive at the multivariate definition for directional derivatives:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:totalDerivative}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]}{\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{H}_q}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1+\alpha\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q+\alpha\tnr{H}_q}-\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}}{\alpha}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tnr{H}_i\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_i$ is an arbitrary direction. When the strategy is to study each variable $\tnr{X}_i$ independently, \emph{caeteris paribus}, development from the concept of tangency is the same as the univariate case, but now the derivative of $\tnr{\varphi}$  is called \textsb{partial derivative}\index{derivative!partial} of $\tnr{\varphi}$ with respect to $\tnr{X}_r$, $1\leqslant r\leqslant q$, represented by \gloref{partialDer}, where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:partialDerivative}
[\fua{\partial_{\tnr{X}_r}\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]{(\tnr{H}_r)}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_r+\alpha\tnr{H}_r,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}-\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}}{\alpha}\,.
\end{equation}
From the above conditions, the property 
\begin{equation}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]}{\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{H}_q}=\sum_{i=1}^{q}[\fua{\partial_{\tnr{X}_i}\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]{(\tnr{H}_i)}\,
\end{equation}
relates total and partial derivatives of multivariate tensor functions and the following equality is commonly known as the \textsb{Chain Rule for Partial Derivatives}\index{Chain Rule!partial derivatives}:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:chainRulePartial}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{\varphi}_1(\tnr{Y}_1),\cdots,\tnr{\varphi}_q(\tnr{Y}_q)}]}{\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{H}_q}=\\
\sum_{i=1}^{q}[\fua{\partial_{\tnr{X}_i}\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{\varphi}_1(\tnr{Y}_1),\cdots,\tnr{\varphi}_q(\tnr{Y}_q)}\circ\tnr{\varphi}_i'(\tnr{Y}_i)]{(\tnr{H}_i)}\,,
\end{multline}
where the function in $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_i}{{\pmb{\mathcal{W}}_i}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_i}$, ${\pmb{\mathcal{W}}_i}\subset\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}$, must obviously be differentiable.

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Let's prove these properties. From \eqref{eq:totalDerivative} and \eqref{eq:partialDerivative} it is clear that, for each direction $\tnr{H}_i$, we have $q$ equalities of the form
\begin{equation*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]}{\tnr{0},\cdots,\tnr{H}_i,\cdots,\tnr{0}}=[\fua{\partial_{\tnr{X}_i}\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}]{(\tnr{H}_i)}\,.
\end{equation*}
By summing up these $q$ equalities, we prove the first property because function $\fua{\tnr{\varphi}'}{\tnr{X}_1,\cdots,\tnr{X}_q}$ is multilinear. Applying the chain rule for partial deriving $\tnr{\varphi}$ with respect to argument $\tnr{\varphi}_i(\tnr{Y}_i)$,  $q$ other equalities are also obtained; and since the derivatives involved are linear and multilinear, the second property is verified by also summing up these equalities. 
\end{proof}}

It is interesting to note that derivatives may be differentiable themselves, and also derivatives of derivatives, and so on. Considering previous conditions, the tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ is defined to be the zero order derivative of itself, function $\tnr{\psi}'$ is the order one derivative of $\tnr{\psi}$, $\tnr{\psi}''$ the order two and $\gloref{derivHigh}$ the order $k\geqslant 0$. Thereby, from definition \eqref{eq:tangentFunct}, a tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ is said to be differentiable of order two at $\tnr{X}_0$ if it is differentiable at $\tnr{X}_0$ and there is a unique function $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(1)}$ tangent to the function in $\map{\tnr{\psi}'}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ where
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(1)}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}''}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}-\tnr{X}_0}\,.
\end{equation*}
Since function $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}\in\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ then  $\map{\tnr{\psi}''}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}}$. Similarly, if $\tnr{\psi}$ is differentiable of order three at $\tnr{X}_0$, then it is differentiable of order two at $\tnr{X}_0$ and there is a unique $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(2)}$ tangent to $\tnr{\psi}''$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ where
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(2)}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}''}{\tnr{X}_0}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'''}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}-\tnr{X}_0}
\end{equation*}
and $\map{\tnr{\psi}'''}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}}}$. Generically, tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ is said to be differentiable of order $k+1$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ if it is differentiable of order $k$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ and there is a unique function $\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(k)}$ tangent to function $\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$ described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tangentOrderK1}
\fua{\tnr{\psi_\mathit{d}}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}_0}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\tnr{X}_0}]}{\tnr{X}-\tnr{X}_0}\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\map{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_{k+1}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_k}{\cdots\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_{1}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}}}}
\end{equation*}
and $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_i=\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. In this case, we also define $\fua{D^{k+1}\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}=[\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\tnr{X}_0}](\tnr{X}_0)$. By a similar development we performed for one order derivative, rule \eqref{eq:tangentOrderK1} leads to equality
\begin{equation}\label{eq:directDerivK1}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}}}{\alpha}\,,
\end{equation}
which is the $k+1$ order directional derivative of $\tnr{\psi}$ along $\tnr{H}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. From previous equality, if $k>0$ the directional derivative of order $k+1$ along a given tensor is always a function and then by choosing arbitrary tensors $\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{H}_{k+1}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, we conclude that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:toOrderZero}
[[\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}_{k+1}}](\tnr{H}_k)\cdots](\tnr{H}_{1})\in\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}\,.
\end{equation}

Now, let's restrict our attention to continuous tensor functions, that is, to elements of function space $\evc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ in this present case, when they are said to be of \textsb{differentiability class}\index{differentiability class} $\mathcal{C}^0$. Function $\tnr{\psi}$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ or \textsb{continuously differentiable}\index{function!continuously differentiable} if it is of class $\mathcal{C}^0$ and differentiable of order one, with derivative $\tnr{\psi}^{'}$ also of differentiability class $\mathcal{C}^0$. In general terms, $\tnr{\psi}$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^{k+1}$ if it is of class $\mathcal{C}^{k}$ and differentiable of order $k+1$, with $\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}$ of class $\mathcal{C}^k$. Stating that function $\tnr{\psi}$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^{k+1}$ is equal to stating that $\tnr{\psi}$ is \textsb{smooth}\index{function!smooth} of order $k+1$ and for the case where $\tnr{\psi}$ is smooth of any order, we say that it is of class $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ or simply call it smooth. A differentiable tensor function is called a \textsb{diffeomorphism}\index{diffeomorphism} if it is a bijection and its inverse is also differentiable. When a diffeomorphism is smooth of order $k+1$, it is called a $\mathcal{C}^{k+1}$-diffeomorphism.

\section{The Gradient}

The concept of gradient we shall detail in this section is restricted to the context of Hilbert tensor spaces because it relies on the Riesz-Fr\'echet Representation of Tensors, described on theorem \ref{teo:repRieszTensor}. Similarly to what we already presented in this chapter, an open set $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subset\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}$ and a differentiable function in $\map{\tnr{\psi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ are also considered, but $\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}$ and $\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}$ are Hilbert tensor spaces here and $m+s>0$. Considering the conditions of the aforementioned theorem, there is a unique tensor $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}$, called the \textsb{gradient}\index{gradient} of $\tnr{\psi}$ at $\tnr{X}_0$, which the derivative $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}\in\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ is the $m$-cotensor of and then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defGradient}
[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}_0}](\tnr{X}) = \tnr{X}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}_0}\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, the tensor function in $\map{\gloref{gradi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$, called the gradient of $\tnr{\psi}$, assigns to a tensor of order $m$ a tensor of order $m+s$. If our interest is to inspect function values only at $\tnr{X}_0=\tnr{X}$, previous equality results
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivSameArg}
\fua{D\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}} = \tnr{X}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}\,.
\end{equation}
If tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ is a differentiable unary tensor operator on $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, that is tensor space $\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}}=\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}=\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{m}}$, its gradient assigns to a $m$-th order tensor a $2m$-th order tensor. 

 For the case of a vector valued vector function, that is $m=s=1$, tensor space $\ete{\cam{F}}{U}=U^*_\cam{F}$, $\ete{\cam{F}}{V}=V^*_\cam{F}$, gradient $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\vto{x}_0^*}\in\ete{\cam{R}}{U\times V}$, derivative $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\vto{x}_0^*}\in\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{V^*_\cam{F}}$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defGradient2}
[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\vto{x}_0^*}](\vto{x}^*) = \vto{x}^*\odot_1\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\vto{x}_0^*}\,.
\end{equation}
Now, from theorem \ref{teo:repRiesz}, we present vector functions
\begin{alignat}{4} \label{eq:primiRepFuncGrad2}
\tnr{\hat{\psi}}:=\Phi^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}\circ\Phi\,, &\qquad   \tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x}_0):=\Phi^{-1}\circ\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\vto{x}_0^*}\circ\Phi  &\qquad \text{ and } \qquad& \nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}:=\nabla\tnr{\psi}\circ\Phi \,,
\end{alignat}
from which we can rewrite equality \eqref{eq:defGradient2} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivVecGradVec}
\fua{[\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x}_0)]}{\vto{x}} = \fua{ \nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}_0}^\dagger\hat{\odot}_1\vto{x}^*\,.
\end{equation}
Comparing this equality with \eqref{eq:Lin2secTensTransp}, we can state that $\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x}_0)$ is the representative function of second order tensor $\fua{ \nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}_0}$, called the gradient of  $\tnr{\hat{\psi}}$ at $\vto{x}_0$. Now, considering equality \eqref{eq:secTens2Lin} and second order tensor $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}_0}=\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\vto{x}_0^*}$, we also have for the present case that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gradFuncRep}
\fua{[\fua{\nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}_0}]}{\vto{x},\vto{y}}=\vto{y}\cdot\fua{[\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x}_0)]}{\vto{x}^{c}}\,,\,\,\forall\, \vto{x},\vto{y}\in\mathcal{U}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{U}$ is constituted by the corresponding vectors to the elements of $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. Considering rule \eqref{eq:directDeriv}, from  definitions \eqref{eq:primiRepFuncGrad2}, it is possible to develop the following for an arbitrary direction $\vto{h}^*\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$:  
\begin{align}\label{eq:derivRep}
\fua{[\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})]}{\vto{h}}&=\Phi^{-1}\circ\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\vto{x}^*}]}{\vto{h}^*}\nonumber\\
&=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\Phi^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}}{\vto{x}^*+\alpha\vto{h}^*}-\fua{\Phi^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}}{\vto{x}^*}}{\alpha}\nonumber\\
&=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\Phi^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}\circ\Phi}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}-\fua{\Phi^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}\circ\Phi}{\vto{x}}}{\alpha}\nonumber\\
&=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}-\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}}}{\alpha}\,,
\end{align}
which results the rule of the directional derivative of the vector function in $\map{\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\mathcal{U}}{V_\cam{F}}$ along $\vto{h}\in\mathcal{U}$. From this result, \emph{the derivative $\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})$, as a linear vector function, inherits all the previous and forthcoming definitions of the linear tensor function $\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\vto{x}^*}$}. For example, from \eqref{eq:derivSameArg} and \eqref{eq:defGradient2}, we can write that vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivSameArg2}
\fua{D\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}} := \fua{[\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})]}{\vto{x}}=\fua{ \nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}}^\dagger\hat{\odot}_1\vto{x}^*\,.
\end{equation}


If the vector function $\tnr{\hat\psi}$ is scalar valued, that is, $V_\cam{F}=\cam{F}$, and $\{\vun{u}_1,\cdots,\vun{u}_n\}$ is an arbitrary orthonormal basis of $U_\cam{F}$, we can obtain that
\begin{equation}
\fua{ \nabla\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\vto{x}_0}=\sum_{i=1}^n\fua{[\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x}_0)]}{\vun{u}_i}\vun{u}_i\,.
\end{equation}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
PROVAR 5.26
\end{proof}}

\noindent Now, in the case of a vector valued real function $\tnr{\hat{\psi}}$, when $U_{\cam{F}}=\cam{F}$, from mapping $\map{\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{\mathcal{U}}{V_\real}$, we can write that $\fua{\tnr{\hat{\psi}}'_{x}}{\beta} = \beta\fua{\tnr{\hat{\psi}}'_{x}}{1}$ for all nonzero $\beta$, since the derivative is linear. In this context, our interest is to describe directional derivative  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivVecScaFun}
\fua{\dfrac{d\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{dx}}{x} := \fua{[\tnr{\hat{\psi}}'(x)]}{1} = \lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{x+\alpha}-\fua{\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{x}}{\alpha}\,. 
\end{equation} 
If $\tnr{\hat{\psi}}$ is differentiable of order $k\geqslant 1$, we adopt  
\begin{equation}
\fua{\dfrac{d^k\tnr{\hat{\psi}}}{dx^k}}{x}:=\fua{[\tnr{\hat{\psi}}^{(k)}(x)]}{1}\,.
\end{equation} 
Moreover, given an arbitrary real number $x_0$ in a context where $U_{\cam{F}}=V_{\cam{F}}=\real$, real function $\hat{\psi}$ is real valued and then we have the classical geometric interpretation of real number $\fua{[d{\hat{\psi}}/dx]}{x_0}$ as being the slope of the tangent line ${\hat{\psi}}_\mathit{d}$ to the curve ${\hat{\psi}}$ at $x_0$. 


REVER
Still in this context, if $\{\vun{u}\}$ is the orthonormal basis of a one dimensional Hilbert space $U_\cam{R}$, it is valid to write
$\fua{[d{\hat{\psi}}/dx]}{x}=[\fua{[d{\hat{\psi}}/dx]}{x}\vun{u}]\cdot\vun{u}$, where  
\begin{equation}
\nabla\fua{{\hat{\psi}}}{x}:=\fua{\dfrac{d{\hat{\psi}}}{dx}}{x}\vun{u}
\end{equation}
is said to be the gradient of ${\hat{\psi}}$ at $x$. But in the case where $\map{{\hat{\psi}}}{\mathcal{U}}{\real}$



Now returning to the conditions of definition \eqref{eq:defGradient}, from the directional derivative of $\tnr{\psi}$ along $\tnr{H}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ and rule \eqref{eq:directDeriv}, it is easy to obtain that
\begin{equation}
\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dfrac{\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}+\alpha\tnr{H}}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}}{\alpha}\,.
\end{equation}
From the properties of derivatives presented on previous section, it is then possible to obtain the following important properties of gradients.
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{.1em}
	\item[i.] If $\tnr{\psi}=\tnr{\psi}_1+\tnr{\psi}_2$ then $\nabla\tnr{\psi}=\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1+\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2\,$;
	\item[ii.] If $\tnr{\psi}=\tnr{i}$ then $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\nabla\tnr{i}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{I}$ for all $\tnr{X}\in\tnr{\mathcal{U}}$;
	\item[iii.] If $\tnr{\psi}=\tnr{\psi}_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2$, where $\map{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ and $\map{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}}$, then
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop1Grad}
	\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}} = \fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}} \odot_r \fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\,;
	\end{equation}	
	\item[iv.] If $\tnr{\psi}$ is a diffeomorphism then $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}\neq\tnr{0}$ because
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:indentDiffeo}
	\tnr{I} = \fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}} \odot_s \fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}\,,
	\end{equation}
	where $\tnr{I}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}\times V^{\times s}}$;	
	\item[v.] If $\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\cdot\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$, where   $\map{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}}$, $\map{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}}$ and domain $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subset\ete{\real}{U^{\times m}}$, then
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop2Grad}
	\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}} = \fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\,;
	\end{equation}
	\item[vi.] If $\nabla\tnr{\psi}$ is a constant function of value $\tnr{T}\in\ete{\real}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}$, that is, $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{T}$ for all $\tnr{X}\in\tnr{\mathcal{U}}$, then 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:gradConst}
	\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{H}_1}-\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{H}_2}=(\tnr{H}_1-\tnr{H}_2)\odot_m\tnr{T}\,;
	\end{equation}
	\item[vii.] If $\tnr{\hat\psi}$ is a diffeomorphism then 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:gradDiffeo2}
	\fua{\nabla\tnr{\hat\psi}^{-1}\circ\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\nabla\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}}^{-1};
	\end{equation}
	\item[viii.] If $\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}$, where $U_\real$ in mappings  $\map{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{{\mathcal{U}}}{U_\cam{R}}$ and $\map{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{{\mathcal{U}}}{U_\cam{R}}$ is properly defined for enabling cross products, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crossRule}
\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})}{\vto{h}} = \fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2'}_{\vto{x}}}{\vto{h}} + \fua{{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1'}_{\vto{x}}}{\vto{h}} \times \fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}\,,\,\forall \vto{h}\in\mathcal{U}\,,
\end{equation}
and then 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop3Grad}
	\fua{D\tnr{\hat\psi}}{\vto{x}} = \fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{D\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}+\fua{D\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}\,.
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
The first item is verified through the following development:
\begin{align*}
\fua{[\fua{[\tnr{\psi}']}{\tnr{X}}}{\tnr{H}}&=\fua{\{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1+\tnr{\psi}'_2]}{\tnr{X}}\}}{\tnr{H}}\\
\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}&=\fua{\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_1}{\tnr{X}}}{\tnr{H}}+\fua{\fua{\tnr{\psi}'_2}{\tnr{X}}}{\tnr{H}}\\
&=\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}+\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\\
&=\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1+\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2]}{\tnr{X}}\,.
\end{align*}	
Property ii is verified by the second property of directional derivatives, from which the non-zero tensor $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{i}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\tnr{H}=\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{i}}{\tnr{X}}$, together with equality \eqref{eq:cotensIdent}. Proof of item iii is obtained from the chain rule, where $\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}=\fua{\{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]\circ\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}\}}{\tnr{H}}$. We can develop the right hand side of this equality using equalities \eqref{eq:compoCotens} because
$\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$ and $\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}$ are the $r$-cotensor and $m$-cotensor of $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$ and $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$ respectively. Item iii is proved by
\begin{align*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}&=\fua{\{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]\circ\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}\}}{\tnr{H}}\\
\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}&=\tnr{H}\odot_m[\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\odot_r\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1\circ\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}]\,.
\end{align*}
Now, applying property iii on $\tnr{i}=\tnr{\psi}^{-1}\circ\tnr{\psi}$ and considering \eqref{eq:cotensIdent}, proof of \eqref{eq:indentDiffeo} is straightforward and the statement of item iv is obvious. From the Leibniz's rule we have
\begin{align*}
\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}&=\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}} \cdot \fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{[\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2'}{\tnr{X}}]}{\tnr{H}}\cdot\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\\
\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}]}{\tnr{X}}&=\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1]}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\tnr{H}\odot_m\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2]}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\\
&=\tnr{H}\odot_m\{\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}_1]}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{[\nabla\tnr{\psi}_2]}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\psi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\}\,,
\end{align*}
which proves item v. For item vi, equality $\fua{\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{X}\odot_m\tnr{T}+\tnr{C}$, labeled by (a) and where $\tnr{C}\in\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}$ is arbitrary, is a function rule from which $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{T}$ when we consider the product rule of directional derivatives and equality \eqref{eq:cotensIdent} in the context of real fields. The subtraction of equalities (a) defined by $\tnr{X}=\tnr{H}_1$ and $\tnr{X}=\tnr{H}_2$ proves the item. Item vii is a straighforward consequence of \eqref{eq:indentDiffeo} and \eqref{eq:identTensor}. Considering $(U_\real,\tnr{A}_B)$ a three dimensional oriented Euclidean space, we prove the equalities of item viii first by the development
\begin{align*}
\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})}{\vto{h}}&=\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha\{\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}[\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}\otimes\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}]-\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}[\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}]\}\\
&=\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}\lim_{\alpha\to 0}1/\alpha\{\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}\otimes\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}-\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}\}
\end{align*}
and then by adding and subtracting the limit on the right hand side by $\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}[\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}+\alpha\vto{h}}\otimes\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}]$ we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}'(\vto{x})}{\vto{h}}= \tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}[\fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2'}_{\vto{x}}}{\vto{h}}]+\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}\fua{{\tnr{\hat\psi}_1'}_{\vto{x}}}{\vto{h}} \otimes \fua{\tnr{\hat\psi}_2}{\vto{x}}]\,,
\end{equation*}
from which we easily verify the first equality of viii. By definition \eqref{eq:derivSameArg2}, proof of the second equality is straightforward. 
\end{proof}}

Still in the context of Hilbert spaces, we define from the concept of gradient three important and very useful tensor functions, namely divergence, Laplacian and curl. Considering the mapping $\map{\tnr{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$ where function $\tnr{\varphi}$ is differentiable on its domain, the function in $\map{\gloref{diverg}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$ is called the \textsb{divergence}\index{divergence} of $\tnr{\varphi}$ if its rule is described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:divergence}
\fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{I}\odot_{2m}\fua{\nabla\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}}\,,
\end{equation}
where identity tensor $\tnr{I}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times U^{\times m}}$ and $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}$. While the gradient always assigns to a tensor $\tnr{X}$ a tensor of higher order, the divergence assigns to $\tnr{X}$ a tensor of lower order only when $s<m$. 
From this concept of divergence and from mapping $\map{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$, it is valid and convenient to define a function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:laplace}
\Delta\tnr{\psi}=\dvt{\nabla\tnr{\psi}}\,,
\end{equation}
called the \textsb{Laplacian}\index{Laplacian} of $\tnr{\psi}$, where $\fua{\gloref{laplac}}{\tnr{X}}\in \ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}$. If $\tnr{\varphi}$ is a unary tensor operator on $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, that is $\map{\tnr{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{m}}}$, then its divergence is a scalar function for all $m>0$. 


Now, let $(U_\real,\tnr{A}_B)$ be a three dimensional oriented Euclidean space, $V_\real$ another Euclidean space and $\map{\tnr{{\varphi}}}{{\tnr{\mathcal{U}}}}{\ete{\cam{R}}{U\times V}}$ a mapping where $\tnr{\mathcal{U}}$ is an open subset of $U_\real^*$. In this context, considering an open set $\tnr{\mathcal{U}}\subset U_\real^*$, it is possible to define a linear mapping  $\map{\gloref{curl}}{{\tnr{\mathcal{U}}}}{\ete{\cam{R}}{U\times V}}$, whose function is called the \textsb{curl}\index{curl} of $\tnr{\varphi}$, with rule
\begin{equation}\label{eq:curl}
\fua{\crl{\tnr{{\varphi}}}}{\vto{x}^*}=\tnr{A}_B\odot_{2}\fua{\nabla\tnr{{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}\,,
\end{equation}
where tensor $\fua{\nabla\tnr{{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}\in\ete{\cam{R}}{U^2\times V}$. Similarly to the case of gradients, there are some notable properties of divergence and curl, presented as follows, where the appropriate previous conditions are implicit.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{.1em}
\item[i.] If $\tnr{\varphi}=\tnr{\varphi}_1+\tnr{\varphi}_2$ then $\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}}=\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}_1}+\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}_2}$ and $\crl{\tnr{\varphi}}=\crl{\tnr{\varphi}_1}+\crl{\tnr{\varphi}_2}\,$;
\item[ii.] If $\tnr{\varphi}=\tnr{\varphi}_1\circ\tnr{\varphi}_2$, where mapping $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$ and mapping $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{W^{\times r}}}$ are defined, then
\begin{equation}
\fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}}}{\tnr{X}} =\fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}_2}}{\tnr{X}}\odot_{r}\fua{\nabla\tnr{\varphi}_1\circ\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\tnr{X}}\,,
\end{equation}	
\item[iii.] If $\tnr{\varphi}=\tnr{\varphi}_1\circ\tnr{\varphi}_2$, where mappings $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U\times W}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U\times V}}$ and $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U\times W}}$ are defined, then
\begin{equation}
\fua{\crl{\tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*} = \fua{\crl{\tnr{\varphi}_2}}{\vto{x}^*}\odot_{2}\fua{\nabla\tnr{{\varphi}}_1\circ\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\vto{x}^*}\,;
\end{equation}	

\item[iv.] If $\fua{\tnr{\varphi}}{\tnr{X}}=\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\cdot\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\tnr{X}}$, where mapping  $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$ and mapping $\map{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{U^{\times m}\times V^{\times s}}}$ are defined, then
\begin{equation}
\fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}}}{\tnr{X}} = \fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}_1}}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\tnr{X}}+\fua{\dvt{\tnr{\varphi}_2}}{\tnr{X}}\odot_s\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\tnr{X}}\,,
\end{equation}	
and for $m=s=1$,
\begin{equation}
\fua{\crl{\tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*} = \fua{\crl{\tnr{\varphi}_1}}{\vto{x}^*}\odot_1\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_2}{\vto{x}^*}+\fua{\crl{\tnr{\varphi}_2}}{\vto{x}^*}\odot_1\fua{\tnr{\varphi}_1}{\vto{x}^*}\,;
\end{equation}

	
\item[v.]	If $\map{\tnr{\varphi}}{\mathcal{U}}{V_\real}$, where $\mathcal{U}\subset U_\real$, then $\fua{\crl{\nabla \tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}=\vto{0}\,$.
\end{itemize}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Considering definitions \eqref{eq:divergence} and \eqref{eq:curl}, since partial inner products are left (right) distributive, proof of item i is trivial. Pre multiplying properties \eqref{eq:prop1Grad}, \eqref{eq:prop2Grad} and \eqref{eq:prop3Grad} adequately by $\tnr{I}$ or $\tnr{A}_B$, proofs of items i, ii, iii and iv are straightforward. For item v, since we already know that $\vto{u}\cdot\tnr{A}_B\hat{\odot}_2\vto{v}^*\otimes\vto{w}^*=\tnr{A}_B(\vto{u},\vto{v},\vto{w})$, if we consider tensor $\fua{{\nabla \tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}=\vto{v}^*\otimes\vto{w}^*$, then $\vto{u}\cdot\fua{\crl{\nabla \tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}=\tnr{A}_B(\vto{u},\vto{v},\vto{w})$ for all $\vto{u}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. Thereby, choosing vector $\vto{u}=\vto{v}$, we have $\vto{v}\cdot\fua{\crl{\nabla \tnr{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}^*}=\tnr{A}_B(\vto{v},\vto{v},\vto{w})=0$ because $\tnr{A}_B$ is antisymmetric, and since $\vto{v}\neq\vto{0}$, we prove the item.
\end{proof}}


Recalling the concept of higher order differentiation presented on the previous section and the conditions of theorem \ref{teo:repRieszTensor}, we can state that if $\tnr{\psi}$ is $k+1$ differentiable at $\tnr{X}_0$ then there is a unique tensor $\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}_0}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{(U^{\times m})^{k+1}\times V^{\times s}}$ which the derivative
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{\psi}^{(k+1)}}{\tnr{X}_0}\in{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_{k+1}}{\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_k}{\cdots\evlc{\cam{F}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_{1}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}}}}
\end{equation*}
is the $m$-cotensor of and each $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}_i=\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ defines a Hilbert space of continuous functions. Moreover, choosing arbitrary directions $\tnr{H}_1,\cdots,\tnr{H}_{k+1}\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ and specifying $r=m\cdot(k+1)$, statement \eqref{eq:toOrderZero} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\tnr{H}_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\tnr{H}_{k+1}\odot_r\fua{\nabla\tnr{\psi}^{(k)}}{\tnr{X}}\in\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}\,.
\end{equation}


\section{Integration}\index{integration}

The integration approach we shall deal with in this section relies fundamentally on Lebesgue's theory, which is based on assigning a real number to a set, whatever measure this scalar expresses. The most commom measures related to sets are the physical concept of mass and the geometric concept of size, that is, length, area, volume or \textsb{hypervolume}\index{hypervolume} of respectively one, two, three or $n$ dimensional Hilbert spaces. In generic terms, a measure must obey certain rules that require and lead to new important definitions. In this context, from specific scalar functions with domains called measurable, integrable tensor functions can be defined.

From the concept of class and its dependent definitions presented on section \ref{sec:Sets}, the double $(M,\css{M})$ is said to be a \textsb{measurable space}\index{space!measurable} when $\sigma$-ring $\css{M}$ is a class of the set $M$; and when this set defines a group or a field we also qualify them with ``measurable''. Now, considering the mapping $\map{\mu}{\css{M}}{\real}$ and an arbitrary disjoint countable class $\{A_1,\cdots,A_n\}\subseteq\css{M}$, set function $\mu$ is called additive if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:addMeasure}
\fua{\mu}{\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i}=\sum_{{i}=1}^n\fua{\mu}{A_i}\,.
\end{equation}
From this definition, it is clear that $\fua{\mu}{\emptyset}=\fua{\mu}{\emptyset\cup\emptyset}=2\fua{\mu}{\emptyset}=0$. For the special case of a mapping $\map{\mu}{\css{C}}{\real^+}$ where $\css{C}$ is a ring, additive nonegative set function $\mu$ is said to be a \textsb{continent}\index{ring!continent} of ring $\css{C}$. But in the case of the $\sigma$-ring $\css{M}$, its continent $\mu$ is called a \textsb{measure}\index{measure} if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:measuSum}
\fua{\mu}{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}=\sum_{{i}=1}^\infty\fua{\mu}{A_i}\,,
\end{equation}
for an arbitrary countable class $\{A_1,A_2,\cdots\}\subseteq\css{M}$. Thereby, we call the double constituted by a measurable space and a measure, that is $((M,\css{M}),\mu)$, a \textsb{measure space}\index{space!measure}, which will hereafter be represented by the triple $(M,\css{M},\mu)$.


Given a measurable field $(\real,\css{F})$, the function in $\map{s}{M}{\real}$ is called \textsb{measurable}\index{function!measurable} if, for every element $\con{B}\in\css{F}$, the preimage $\con{R}^{-1}_{\con{B}} \in \css{M}$. Considering a disjoint countable class $\{A_1,\cdots,A_n\}\subseteq\css{M}$ and $\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\in\real$, where $\css{A}=\{A_1,\cdots,A_n\}$ is called a \textsb{partition}\index{set!partition of} of an arbitrary set $A\in\css{M}$, that is $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$, the measurable function in $\map{s_\css{A}}{M}{\real}$ is called \textsb{step}\index{function!step} or \textsb{simple}\index{function!simple} with respect to $\css{A}$ if its rule is described by
\begin{equation}
\fua{s_\css{A}}{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i}}{x}\,,
\end{equation}
where the function in $\map{\tnr{1}_{A_i}}{A_i}{\real}$ is commonly known as the \textsb{indicator function}\index{function!indicator} of $A_i$, defined by
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i}}{x}=
\begin{dcases}
0 & \text{if } x\notin A_i\\
1 & \text{if } x\in A_i
\end{dcases}\,.
\end{equation*}
In the particular case of a measure space $(M,\css{M},\mu)$, a step function $s_\css{A}$ is defined to be \textsb{integrable}\index{function!integrable step} on set $E\in\css{M}$ when for every $\alpha_i\neq 0$, scalar $\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i}$ is finite. If this is the case, the real number
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defInteSimp}
\int_E s_\css{A} := \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i}
\end{equation}
is called the \textsb{integral}\index{integral!of step function} of $s_\css{A}$ on $E$. In this context, if $\css{B}=\{B_1,\cdots,B_m\}\subseteq\css{M}$ is another partition of $A$, we conclude that there is no element of $A$ which does not belong to some $A_i\cap B_j$ and then it is obvious that class 
\begin{equation*}
\css{C}=\{A_1\cap B_1,A_1\cap B_2,\cdots,A_1\cap B_m,A_2\cap B_1,\cdots,A_n\cap B_m\}
\end{equation*}
is disjoint and also a partition of $A$. Moreover, since $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i=\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_i$, it is obvious that $A_i=\bigcup_{j=1}^mA_i\cap B_j$ and $B_j=\bigcup_{i=1}^n B_j \cap A_i$. From previous definition, we can write
\begin{equation*}
\int_E s_\css{C} = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\gamma_{ij}\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i\cap B_j}\,,
\end{equation*}
which means that
\begin{equation*}
\fua{s_\css{C}}{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\gamma_{ij}\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i\cap B_j}}{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n\underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m\gamma_{ij}\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i\cap B_j}}{x}}_{\alpha_i\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i}}{x}}=\sum_{j=1}^m\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n\gamma_{ij}\fua{\tnr{1}_{B_i\cap A_j}}{x}}_{\beta_j\fua{\tnr{1}_{B_j}}{x}}\,.
\end{equation*}
Thereby, from these equalities, scalar 
\begin{align*}
\int_E s_\css{A} &= \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i}\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\fua{\mu}{E\cap \bigcup_{j=1}^mA_i\cap B_j}\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i\cap B_j}\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^m\beta_j\fua{\mu}{E\cap \bigcup_{i=1}^nB_j\cap A_i}\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^m\beta_j\fua{\mu}{E\cap B_j}\\
&=\int_E s_\css{B}\,,
\end{align*}
since intersection is distributive on union and $\mu$ is additive according to \eqref{eq:addMeasure}. For integration purposes, this equality enables us to remove the identification of the partition of $A$ from the representation of the function in a step mapping $\map{s}{M}{\real}$, since the integral of $s$ is the same for any partition of arbitrary $A\subseteq M$.

In the set of all measurable functions on $(M,\css{M},\mu)$, let $(S,\varrho)$ be a normed metric space of integrable step functions on $E$ with norm and metric respectively defined by
\begin{alignat*} {3}
\|s\|=\int_E |s|&\qquad \text{ and } \qquad&\fua{\varrho}{s_1,s_2}=\|s_1-s_2\|\,,
\end{alignat*}
where $|s|(x):=|\fua{s}{x}|$ and $s,s_1,s_2\in S$. In this context, if a Cauchy sequence of integrable step functions $s_1,s_2,\cdots\in S$ exists and converges to the measurable function in $\map{f}{M}{\real}$, we say that $f$ is integrable or Labesgue integrable on $E$ and scalar
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integ}
\int_E f := \lim_{i\to \infty}\int_E s_i
\end{equation}
is the integral or Labesgue integral of $f$ on $E$. It is important to say that if $s_1,s_2,\cdots\in S$ and $t_1,t_2,\cdots\in S$ are convergent Chauchy sequences of integrable step functions, so is sequence $ s_1+t_1, s_2+ t_2,\cdots$. Moreover, if the function in $\map{g}{M}{\real}$ is measurable, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cauchySum}
s_1,s_2,\cdots\to f\,\,\, \wedge\,\,\, t_1,t_2,\cdots\to g \implies \alpha s_1+ \beta t_1, \alpha s_2+ \beta t_2,\cdots\to \alpha f+\beta g\,.
\end{equation}

{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Since scalar multiplication does not affect the convergence of Cauchy sequences $s_1,s_2,\cdots$ and $t_1,t_2,\cdots$, we will verify only the effect of the sum. First we prove that $  h_1+ r_1,h_2+ r_2,\cdots$, where $h_i=\alpha s_i$ and $r_i=\beta t_i$, is also a Cauchy sequence. If both expressions $\lim_{\min{\lpa i,j\rpa}\to\infty}{\fua{\varrho}{h_i,h_j}}=0$ and $\lim_{\min{\lpa i,j\rpa}\to\infty}{\fua{\varrho}{r_i,r_j}}=0$ are valid, then, by summing these two equalities, we obtain $\lim_{\min{\lpa i,j\rpa}\to\infty}\fua{\varrho}{h_i,h_j}+\fua{\varrho}{r_i,r_j}=0\,$. From the property of triangular inequality of norms, since
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\varrho}{h_i,h_j}+\fua{\varrho}{r_i,r_j} = \|h_i-h_j\| + \|r_i-r_j\| \geqslant \|h_i-h_j + r_i-r_j\|\,,
\end{equation*}
it is obvious that $\lim_{\min{\lpa i,j\rpa}\to\infty}\|(h_i+ r_i) -(h_j +r_j)\|=0\,$, which proves the sum to be a Cauchy sequence. The convergence to $\alpha f+\beta g$ can be  proved by this same procedure.
\end{proof}}

Given the above conditions, we present some fundamental properties of integrals:


\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{.1em}
	\item[i.] If $f$ is integrable and nonnegative, then its integral on $E$ is also nonnegative;
	\item[ii.] If $f$ is integrable on every element of disjoint class $\{E_1,\cdots,E_m\}\subseteq \css{M}$, then
	\begin{equation}
	\int_{\bigcup_{i=1}^mE_i}f=\sum_{{i}=1}^{m} \int_{E_i}f\,;
	\end{equation}
	\item[iii.] If $f$ is integrable on $E\in\css{M}$ and $\fua{\mu}{E}=0$, then
	\begin{equation}
	\int_{E}f =0\,;
	\end{equation}
	 \item[iv.] If $f$ and $g$ are integrable on $E\in\css{M}$ and scalars $\alpha,\beta\in\real$ are arbitrary, then
	 \begin{equation}
	 \int_{E}(\alpha f +\beta g) = \alpha\int_{E}f+\beta\int_{E}g \,.
	 \end{equation}
\end{itemize}


\begin{proof}
{\footnotesize
In order to prove item i, let's specify a sequence of integrable step functions $s_1,s_2,\cdots$ where
\begin{equation*}
\fua{s_k}{x}=\sum_{{i}=1}^n(\fua{f}{x}+k^{-1})\fua{\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}}}{x}
\end{equation*}
is defined from partitioning $A^{(k)}\subset M$. This is obviously a Cauchy sequence that converges to $f$ as $k\to\infty$ and since the coefficients of $s_k$ are nonnegative, then
\begin{equation*}
\int_E f=\lim_{k\to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n(\fua{f}{x}+k^{-1})\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i}\geqslant 0\,.
\end{equation*}
Considering equality \eqref{eq:measuSum} and definition \eqref{eq:integ}, we prove item ii by
\begin{align*}
\int_{\bigcup_{i=1}^mE_i}f &= \lim_{k\to \infty}\int_{\bigcup_{i=1}^mE_i} s_k\\
&=\lim_{k\to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n\alpha_{j}^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{A_j^{(k)}\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^m E_i}\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^m\lim_{k\to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n\alpha_{j}^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{ E_i\cap A_j^{(k)}}\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^m\lim_{k\to \infty} \int_{E_i} s_k = \sum_{i=1}^m \int_{E_i} f\,.
\end{align*}
Now, since $\mu$ is nonnegative and additive, that is $\fua{\mu}{X\cup Y}=0\Longleftrightarrow\fua{\mu}{X}=\fua{\mu}{Y}=0$, and partitioned set $A$ on \eqref{eq:defInteSimp} is arbitrary, then choosing $E$ to be partitioned we prove item iii by
\begin{equation*}
\int_E f = \lim_{k\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_{i}^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{ E\cap E_i^{(k)}} = \lim_{k\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_{i}^{(k)}\underbrace{\fua{\mu}{E_i^{(k)}}}_{0} = 0
\end{equation*}
For item iv, let's specify two partitions $\{A_1^{(k)},\cdots,A_n^{(k)}\}$ and $\{B_1^{(k)},\cdots,B_m^{(k)}\}$ of a set $A^{(k)}\subset M$ which define two step functions $s_k=\sum_{{i}=1}^n\alpha^{(k)}_i\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}}$ and $t_k=\sum_{{j}=1}^m\beta^{(k)}_j\tnr{1}_{B_j^{(k)}}$ in such a way that
\begin{align*}
\alpha\int_{E}f+\beta\int_{E}g&=\lim_{k\to\infty}\alpha\int_{E}s_k + \lim_{k\to\infty}\beta\int_{E}t_k\\
&=\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha\alpha_i^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i^{(k)}}+\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{j=1}^m\beta\beta_j^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{E\cap B_j^{(k)}}\\
&=\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\alpha\alpha_i^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}} + \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\beta\beta_j^{(k)}\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}\\
&=\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m(\alpha\alpha_i^{(k)}+\beta\beta_j^{(k)})\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}\tag{a}\label{eq:a}.
\end{align*}
Now, let's verify that a sum of two step functions is also a step function:
\begin{align*}
\alpha s_k+\beta t_k&=\sum_{{i}=1}^n\alpha\alpha^{(k)}_i\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}}+\sum_{{j}=1}^m\beta\beta^{(k)}_j\tnr{1}_{B_j^{(k)}}\\
&=\sum_{{i}=1}^n\sum_{{j}=1}^m\alpha\alpha^{(k)}_i\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}+\sum_{{i}=1}^n\sum_{{j}=1}^m\beta\beta^{(k)}_j\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}\\
&=\sum_{{i}=1}^n\sum_{{j}=1}^m(\alpha\alpha_i^{(k)}+\beta\beta_j^{(k)})\tnr{1}_{A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}\,.
\end{align*}
Thereby, from  property \eqref{eq:cauchySum}, we have
\begin{equation*}
\int_E \alpha f+\beta g = \lim_{k\to\infty}\int_E\alpha s_k+\beta t_k = \lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m(\alpha\alpha_i^{(k)}+\beta\beta_j^{(k)})\fua{\mu}{E\cap A_i^{(k)}\cap B_j^{(k)}}\,,
\end{equation*}
which is equal to result \eqref{eq:a}.
}\end{proof}


Now, our goal is to integrate a broader class of functions other than functionals, namely, tensor functions. Considering $\ete{\real}{U^{\times m}}$ and $\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}$ Euclidean tensor spaces, let the functional in mapping $\map{f}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\real}$ be a composition of functions described by $f = \frt{T}\circ\tnr{\psi}$, where domain $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subseteq\ete{\real}{U^{\times m}}$, function $\frt{T}$ is the representative tensor functional of an arbitrary tensor $\tnr{T}\in\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}$, according to equalities \eqref{eq:repTensFunc}, and $\tnr{\psi}$ defines a tensor mapping $\map{\tnr{\psi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\cam{F}}{V^{\times s}}}$. We impose that function $\tnr{\psi}$ is integrable on $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ if and only if functional $f$ is integrable on $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. If this is the case, by specifying a rule
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aga}
\fua{\tnr{h}}{\tnr{X}} = \int_{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}} \frt{X}\circ\tnr{\psi}\,,
\end{equation}
where tensor functional $\tnr{h}\in\eted{\real}{V^{\times s}}$ is linear because of definition \eqref{eq:repTensFunc} and property iv above, there exists a unique tensor $\tnr{H}\in\ete{\real}{V^{\times s}}$ which $\tnr{h}$ is the cotensor of, according to corollary \ref{cor:eqNorm}. In this context, tensor
\begin{equation}
\int_{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}\tnr{\psi}:=\tnr{H}
\end{equation}
is called the integral of tensor function $\tnr{\psi}$ on $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. Therefore, since $\fua{\tnr{h}}{\tnr{X}}=\tnr{X}\cdot\tnr{H}$, we conclude from \eqref{eq:aga} that scalar
\begin{equation}\label{eq:repInte}
\tnr{X}\cdot\int_{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}\tnr{\psi}=\int_{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}} \frt{X}\circ\tnr{\psi}\,.
\end{equation}

\section{Integral Identities}

In rough geometrical terms, domains whose boundary shapes show a specific form of regularity -- where sharp edges and different types of self intersection are not allowed, as shown in figure \ref{fg:naoRegulares} -- enable identities that equalize integrations on surfaces and interiors, which are fundamental for Mathematical Physics. First of all, we recall the biunivocal correspondence between an affine space and a vector space established by defining a coordinate system, as shown in section \ref{sec:affine}, in order to henceforth make geometrical statements and assumptions on finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. In this context and from the concept of smoothness presented on section \ref{sec:diffe}, a set of strong mathematical requirements that avoid the irregularities cited above is given by introductory texts on Differential Geometry, such as \aut{Do Carmo}\cite{docarmo_2016}, where surfaces called smooth are defined. However, for the sake of generality, we choose to study a less restrictive regularity condition, which defines the so called Lipschitz surface\footnote{ See \aut{Ciarlet}\cite{ciarlet_1988_2}, p.32.}; that also does not present the above irregularities and is less complex to work with than smooth surfaces. We shall adopt this concept by adapting the accessible approach of \aut{Adams \& Fournier}\cite{adams_2003_2}, which is more than sufficient for our purposes\footnote{For a more rigorous treatment, see \aut{Agranovich}\cite{agranovitch_2015_1}, chapter 3.}.

Let $U_\real$ be a $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, $n\geqslant 2\,$, and $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ one of its proper subsets, which we assume to be a domain of a certain function. Considering an arbitrary non zero scalar $\alpha\in\real^+$, a disjoint cover $\css{C}=\{\widehat{C}_1,\cdots,\widehat{C}_r\}$ of boundary $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ and a class $\{A_1,\cdots,A_r\}$ where each set $A_i\subset C_i$ defines a $(n-1)$-dimensional Euclidean subspace of $U_\real$ from the first $n-1$ dimensions of $U_\real$, the subset $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ is called a \textsb{Lipschitz domain}\index{domain!Lipschitz} and its boundary a \textsb{Lipschitz surface}\index{surface!Lipschitz} if both of the following conditions are observed.

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{.1em}
	\item[i.] Every element $\widehat{C}_j$ of $\css{C}$ must have a specific shape such that arbitrary vectors 
\begin{equation*}
\vto{u},\vto{v}\in\{\vto{x}^*\in\pmb{\mathcal{U}}:\min_{\vto{y}\in \partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}\fua{\varrho}{\vto{x},\vto{y}}<\alpha\}\,,
\end{equation*}
where distance $\fua{\varrho}{\vto{u},\vto{v}}<\alpha$, are also elements of the subset	
\begin{equation*}
\{\vto{x}\in\widehat{C}_j:\min_{\vto{y}\in \partial C_j}\fua{\varrho}{\vto{x},\vto{y}}>\alpha\}\,;
\end{equation*}

	\item[ii.] Every set $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\cap \widehat{C}_j$ must be on the same ``side'' of boundary $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, whose points coordinates must constitute the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function. In other words, there must exist a set of Lipschitz continuous functionals $\{\vtf{g}_1,\cdots,\vtf{g}_r\}$ where $\map{\vtf{g}_j}{A_j}{\real}$ in such a way that for an orthonormal basis $B_j=\{\vun{v}_1^{(j)},\cdots,\vun{v}_n^{(j)}\}$ of $\widehat{C}_j$, the nonnegative real number
\begin{equation*}
|\fua{\vtf{f}_n^{B_j}}{\vto{x}}|<|\vtf{g}_j[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\fua{\vtf{f}_i^{B_j}}{\vto{x}}\vun{v}_i^{(j)}]|\,,\,\forall \vto{x}\in \pmb{\mathcal{U}}\cap\widehat{C}_j.
\end{equation*}	
\end{itemize}

Considering $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subset U_\cam{R}$ a Lipschitz domain, we additionally require orientation of the Lipschitz surface $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ on each of its points. In order to adequately accomplish this, let $\pmb{\mathcal{W}}$ be a $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace of $U_\cam{R}$ and the function in $\map{\vtf{g}}{\pmb{\mathcal{W}}}{\real}$ be Lipschitz continuous whose graph describes $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ in such a way that
\begin{equation*}
\fua{\vtf{f}_n^B}{\vto{v}} = \fua{\vtf{g}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\fua{\vtf{f}_i^B}{\vto{v}}\vun{u}_i}\,,\,\forall\,\vto{v}\in\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\,,
\end{equation*}
where $B=\{\vun{u}_1,\cdots,\vun{u}_n\}$ is an arbitrary orthonormal basis of $U_\real$. Thereby, the function in mapping $\map{\vtf{s}}{U_\cam{R}}{\real}$ where
\begin{alignat}{3}\label{eq:impliSurf}
\fua{\vtf{s}}{\vto{v}} = \fua{\vtf{f}_n^B}{\vto{v}} - \fua{\vtf{g}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\fua{\vtf{f}_i^B}{\vto{v}}\vun{u}_i}=0& \quad\text{and} \quad &\fua{\nabla\vtf{s}}{\vto{v}}\neq 0\,,\,\forall\,\vto{v}\in\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\,,
\end{alignat}
is called the \textsb{implicit function}\index{function!implict} of $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ and since it is constant, equality $[\fua{\vtf{s}'}{\vto{v}}](\vto{h})=0$ is valid along any direction $\vto{h}\in\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. Therefore,  from \eqref{eq:defGradient}, we can say that $\vto{h}\cdot\fua{\nabla\vtf{s}}{\vto{v}}=0$ for all $\vto{h}\in\{\viz{\vto{v}}\cap\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\}$, that is, vector $\fua{\nabla\vtf{s}}{\vto{v}}$ is orthogonal to surface $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ at arbitrary $\vto{v}\in\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$. From this conclusion, surface $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ is called \textsb{orientable}\index{surface!orientable} if it is possible to define a mapping $\map{\vtf{n}}{\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{U_\cam{R}}$ whose function, called the \textsb{unit normal function}\index{function!unit normal} on $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$, is described by
\begin{equation}
\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}=\dfrac{\fua{\nabla\vtf{s}}{\vto{x}}}{\|\fua{\nabla\vtf{s}}{\vto{x}}\|}\,.
\end{equation}
Additionally to $\vtf{n}$, it is true that an implicit function $-\vtf{s}$ leads to a unit normal function $-\vtf{n}$ and when one of these directions $\vtf{n}$ or $-\vtf{n}$ is specified as positive, we say that $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ is \textsb{oriented}\index{surface!oriented}. For the purposes of this study, we choose $\vtf{n}$ to orientate the surfaces. In the case of three-dimensional Euclidean spaces, the values of function $\vtf{n}$ are outward unit vectors with respect to the surface and the values of $-\vtf{n}$ are inward unit vectors.

From what we have studied so far, it is finally possible to attain the objective of this section which is to present a fundamental identity of elementary Calculus, called the \textsb{Gauss-Ostrogradsky} or the \textsb{Divergence}\index{theorem!Divergence} theorem. We shall not deal with its most general form, the notorious Generalized Stokes' theorem, because it would demand us to cover an extensive material on Exterior Calculus, which is out of the scope of this work\footnote{For an introduction to Exterior Calculus, see \aut{Flanders}\cite{flanders_1989_1}, \aut{Loomis \& Sternberg}\cite{loomis_2014_1}  and \aut{Spivak}\cite{spivak_1965_1}.}. In general terms, the following theorem relates projections of function values on unit normals along the domain boundary (flux) with the divergence of the function on the domain interior.

\begin{mteo}{Gauss-Ostrogradsky}{gauss}
Considering $U_\real$ and $\ete{\real}{U\times V^{\times s}}$ finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, $\map{\vtf{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\real}{U\times V^{\times s}}}$ a continuous mapping where $\pmb{\mathcal{U}}\subset U_\real$ is a Lipschitz domain, $\vtf{\varphi}$ continuously differentiable on interior $\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}$, surface $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{U}}$ oriented by a unit normal vector function $\vtf{n}$ and
$\map{\vtf{\varphi}_\odot}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\real}{U\times V^{\times s}}}$ a continuous mapping
where $\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_\odot}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\odot_1\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}$,
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\dvt{\vtf{\varphi}} = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\odot\,\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{mteo}
\hspace{1pt}
{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Instead of developing here this very long demonstration, we invite the interested reader to see the elegant proof presented by \aut{Figueiredo}\cite{figueiredo_1964_1} in the context of $n$-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
\end{proof}
}

\begin{mcoro}{Gauss-Ostrogradsky for Gradients}{gauss2}
For a continuous mapping $\map{\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{\ete{\real}{U\times V^{\times s}}}$ where $\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}$,
\begin{equation*}
	\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}} = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes\,\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{mcoro}
{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Considering identity tensor $\tnr{I}\in\ete{\real}{U^2}$ and property \eqref{eq:repInte}, we can write that
\begin{align*}
\tnr{I}\odot_2	\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}} & = \tnr{I}\odot_2 \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes\\
\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}} \frt{I}\circ\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}}& =\int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\frt{I}\circ\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes\,.
\end{align*}
But from definition \eqref{eq:repTensFunc}, we have equalities $\fua{\frt{I}\circ\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}}=\tnr{I}\cdot\fua{\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}}=\tnr{I}\odot_2\fua{\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\dvt{\vtf{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}}$ and from \eqref{eq:identidade} we have $\fua{\frt{I}\circ\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes}{\vto{x}}=\tnr{I}\cdot[\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}]=\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\odot_1\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_\odot}{\vto{x}}$\,.	From theses results, we arrive at the previous theorem.
\end{proof}
}

\begin{mcoro}{Gauss-Ostrogradsky for Curls}{gauss3}
In the case of continuous mappings $\map{\vtf{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{U_\real}$ and $\map{\vtf{\varphi}_\times}{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}{U_\real}$ where $(U_\real,\tnr{A}_B)$ is an three dimensional oriented Euclidean space and $\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_\times}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}$,
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\crl{\vtf{\varphi}} = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\times\,\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{mcoro}
{\footnotesize
\begin{proof}
Considering \eqref{eq:repInte}, \eqref{eq:crossProduct}, \eqref{eq:repTensFunc}, we have $\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\times\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}=\tnr{A}_B\odot_2[\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\otimes\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}]=\fua{\frt{A}_B\circ\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes}{\vto{x}}$. Thereby, we arrive at corollary \ref{cor:gauss2} by
\begin{align*}
\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\crl{\vtf{\varphi}} & = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\times\\
\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\tnr{A}_B\odot_2\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}} & = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\frt{A}_B\circ\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes\\
\tnr{A}_B\odot_2\int_{\hat{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\nabla{\vtf{\varphi}} & = \tnr{A}_B\odot_2\int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{U}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_\otimes\,.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
}



For the next theorem, we first need to define a function that assigns a tangent vector to each of the elements of a curve\footnote{For an introductory approach of the theory of curves, see \aut{Do Carmo}\cite{docarmo_2016} or \aut{Kreyszig}\cite{kreyszig_1991_1}.}. Given an open interval $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)\subset\real$ and a $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $U_\real$, if the function in $\map{r}{(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)}{U_\real}$ is continuously differentiable on its domain and its image is a curve $\pmb{\mathcal{R}}$, then $r$ is called the parametric function of $\pmb{\mathcal{R}}$. In this context, we are interested in parametric functions that are injections, when their generated curves are classified as \textsb{simple}\index{simple curve}. From the terms of definition \eqref{eq:defGradient}, we conclude mapping $\map{\nabla r}{(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)}{U_\real}$, where $\fua{\nabla r}{x}$ is a $n$-dimensional vector, and then specify a mapping $\map{\vtf{\tau}}{\pmb{\mathcal{R}}}{U_\real}$ such that $\pmb{\mathcal{R}}$ is a simple curve and $\vtf{\tau}$ is called the \textsb{unit tangent vector function}\index{function!unit tangent vector} on $\pmb{\mathcal{R}}$ if it is described by
\begin{equation}
\fua{\vtf{\tau}}{\vto{x}} = \dfrac{\fua{\nabla r\circ r^{-1}}{\vto{x}}}{\|\fua{\nabla r\circ r^{-1}}{\vto{x}}\|}\,.
\end{equation}

There are Lipschitz surfaces in three dimensional Euclidean spaces for which it is possible to define a boundary, like elliptic paraboloids for example. In general terms, the intersection of a bounded set $A$ with an open ball centered at an arbitrary element of boundary $\partial A$ is not a subset of the interior of $A$. Considering this idea on a three dimensional Euclidean space $U_\real$, the boundary of a surface $\pmb{\mathcal{S}}\subset U_\real$ is a curve $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}\subset\pmb{\mathcal{S}}$ constituted by points $\vto{x}\in\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}$ such that $B_{\vto{x},r}\cap\pmb{\mathcal{S}}\not\subset\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}$ for all $r\in\real$. For three dimensional Lipschitz surfaces with boundaries that are simple curves, we present the following classical theorem that establishes a relationship between an integral on a surface and an integral on its boundary.

\begin{mteo}{Kelvin-Stokes}{stokes}
Let $(U_\real,\tnr{A}_B)$ be a three dimensional oriented Euclidean space and $\map{\vtf{\varphi}}{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}{\ete{\real}{U\times V}}$ a mapping where  $\vtf{\varphi}$ is continuously differentiable on Lipschitz surface $\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}\subset U_\real$, which is oriented by an outward unit normal vector function $\vtf{n}$. Considering $\vtf{\tau}$ a unit tangent vector function on boundary $\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}\subset\pmb{\mathcal{S}}$ such that $\map{\vtf{\varphi}_{\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}{\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}{V_\real}$ and $\map{\vtf{\varphi}_{\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}}{\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}{V_\real}$ are continuous mappings where $\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_{\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{\tau}}{\vto{x}}\odot_1\fua{\vtf{\varphi}}{\vto{x}}$ and $\fua{\vtf{\varphi}_{\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}}{\vto{x}}=\fua{\vtf{n}}{\vto{x}}\odot_1\fua{\crl{\vtf{\varphi}}}{\vto{x}}$,
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\widehat{{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_{\widehat{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}} = \int_{\partial{\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}}\vtf{\varphi}_{\partial\pmb{\mathcal{S}}}\,\,.
\end{equation*}
