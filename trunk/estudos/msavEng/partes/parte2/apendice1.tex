\chapter{English Translation of Cauchy's \textit{De La Pression ou Tension Dans Les Corps Solides}}\label{ch:appA}

The text in the following pages is my English translation of the seminal paper entitled \textit{De La Pression ou Tension Dans Les Corps Solides}, by \aut{Cauchy}\cite{cauchySolid_1889}, which effectively marks the beginning of Continuum Mechanics\footnote{See chapter \ref{ch:IntroCM} for historical details.}. With the exception of minor corrections and adaptations I made, the author's style and mathematical nomenclature were strictly reproduced.
